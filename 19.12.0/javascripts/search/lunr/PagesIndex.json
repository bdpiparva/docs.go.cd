For example you may want to run a system update on all linux agents, or install a new piece of software. GoCD will run the Job on all agents that match the environment and resources specified in the job. If an agent is missing or lost contact, a job will be scheduled. When the agent comes back on line, the job will be re-scheduled. Jobs are given a unique name based on the name of the job in the configuration file. So for example, if the job is called 'deploy' and you have two agents, you would see jobs like 'deploy-runOnAll-1' and 'deploy-runOnAll-2'. Configure through the Admin UI To enable run on all agents for a job, navigate to the Job settings page in the job configuration Configure through the Config XML To specify that a job should run on all agents, add the attribute runOnAllAgents=\"true\" to the job's definition  see configuration reference for ``     ... Run 'X' instances of a Job If you want to run multiple instances of the same job configuration you do not have to maintain multiple copies of same job config. You can specify how many instances of job you need & Go will take care of spawing the required number of job instances during scheduling. This feature is particularly useful for test parallelization. It enables Go users to integrate with other test parallelization tools like TLB etc. to achieve distributed test execution with minimal configuration. Jobs are given a unique name based on the name of the job in the configuration file. Example, if the job is called 'test' and you have set runInstanceCount to 2, you would see jobs like 'test-runInstance-1' and 'test-runInstance-2'. Go provides index of job  GO_JOB_RUN_INDEX  & total count of jobs  GO_JOB_RUN_COUNT  as environment variables to each Job. Configure through the Admin UI To run 'x' instances of a job, navigate to the Job settings page in the job configuration Configure through the Config XML To specify that 'x' instances of a job should run, add the attribute runInstanceCount=\"5\" to the job's definition  see configuration reference for ``     ...

Note: In case the http server is unable to bind usually because of port conflicts, or multiple agents running on the same machine, a warning will be emitted to the console log and agent startup will continue.

Rather than start from scratch with command name and arguments, you now have the option to look up a command from a repository of useful commands maintained by the Go team. The lookup provides a starting point, you may need to edit the arguments, specify a working directory etc. Once saved, the behaviour is the same as a manually entered custom command. Take a look at this video to learn more. Using the command repository This feature can be used anywhere you need to specify a custom command. Add a new pipeline Add a new stage to a pipeline Add a new job to a stage Add a new task to a job Edit a task Custom commands and agents Go does not check if the command that you have specified is available on the agents. Install the relevant command on all the agents where you want it to run. If it is not available on the default path, add it to the path in /etc/default/go-agent or equivalent. This requires an agent restart. Alternatively, create a symbolic link to the path to the executable from /bin or equivalent folder. This doesn't require an agent restart Args style commands The older args style commands are not supported by this feature. Please convert them to the new syntax using the config xml editor   Admin > Config XML  . For example: becomes   a   b   c Bundled Repository The default set of commands come from https://github.com/gocd/go-command-repo. This repository is maintained by the Go team. The Go server installer bundles a clone of this Git repository under /db/command_repository/default. Every upgrade of Go Server will overwrite the contents of this directory with an up to date set of commands. Hence, please do not add your commands here. Instead, set up a private repository. Pulling Updates Go team will continue to add  and sometimes update  commands to the repository on GitHub. If you want to make these commands available to your Go server without waiting for a new release or without upgrading your Go server, you could git pull them into /db/command_repository/default as desired. Linux/Unix Here is a simple cron tab entry that you could add to Go service account's cron tab to pull commands once a day. @daily cd /db/command_repository/default;git pull >>/var/go/cronrun 2>&1 Caution: Don't pull as root/administrator. Use the Go service account. Windows On Windows, you could set up a scheduled task to run this script on a schedule. echo %date% %time% >>c:\\pull-log.txt 2>&1 cd \"C:\\Program Files  x86 \\Go Server\\db\\command_repository\\default\" git pull >>c:\\pull-log.txt 2>&1 Go caches these commands with a refresh interval of 30 minutes so you may not see the results of a pull immediately in the lookup unless you hit the reload cache button under the command repository section on the server configuration admin page. Via API You may make a POST request to the path /go/api/admin/command-repo-cache/reload in order to update the command repository with the latest. $ curl -u username:password -X POST -H 'Confirm: true' http://goserver.com:8153/go/api/admin/command-repo-cache/reload Private Repository If you want to add your own commands for look up, you should set up your own Git/Mercurial/Subversion/Perforce/TFS repository that your command authors can commit/check-in into. Make a clone/working copy available under /db/command_repository/. Symbolic links are not supported. Then switch Go Server to this location. To do this, go to Command Repository Management section of Server Configuration in Admin tab and change the default value From the Go server's point of view, the command repository is just a directory under which it recursively looks for valid command.xml files. Note that directory names starting with a dot will be ignored. Go will not lookup from the bundled repository if you switch to your own repository. You could choose to manually seed your private command repository with Go's bundled set of commands if you want to have them in addition to your own commands.

The repo is available at /db/config.git. Any changes to the config, either through file-system, API or GoCD configuration UI is saved as a new commit in this repo. This allows auditing of all changes made to the configuration. NOTE: This repo must not be altered externally as this will lead to errors in GoCD. Garbage collection With time, this repository grows in size and can considerably slow down config save operations. One way to tackle this is to run git gc manually on the repo  read more . However, doing this at the wrong time  say, when the server is running and trying to finish a config save operation  can cause problems. So, GoCD has in-built garbage collection for this git repository and it can be configured to run on a periodic basis. However, since this activity can potentially take a long time to run when GC happens for the first time around, the feature is turned off by default. GoCD server periodically checks if the loose-object count exceeds a preset threshold and displays a warning message. This is a cue for users to enable periodic GC on their servers. Here are the steps you need to follow  and in this order  to enable periodic GC for the config repository: Stop the GoCD server. Take a backup of the whole config.git directory  rememeber, there is a hidden .git directory in it Run git gc manually, once, in that directory as the user that the GoCD server runs under. On Unix/Linux, this is usually the go user. Do not run this as the root user. If you do, make sure that you run chown -R go:go /path/to/config.git to make sure that the ownership of that directory is proper. Once you've done that, you can now set these system properties mentioned below, to change the behavior of the periodic garbage collection. At the very least, you should set the go.config.repo.gc.periodic system property to Y so that it is enabled. Start the server and verify that the properties you've set are reflected in the system. The section at the end of this page has details about it. System properties that affect periodic garbage collection System property Default Value Description go.config.repo.gc.periodic false Flag that enables the periodic garbage collection of config.git repository. go.config.repo.gc.aggressive true This will cause the GC to run more aggressively. For large repositories, this can take a significant amount of time. It is recommended to set this to false if the frequency of GC is very high. go.config.repo.gc.cron 0 0 7 ? * SUN  7 am on Sunday morning The cron expression that describes when GC should happen. go.config.repo.gc.warning.looseobject.threshold 10000 If loose object count grows beyond this threshold, a warning is displayed in the server health messages popup. go.config.repo.gc.expire 24   in hours Objects older than this period  in hours  will be pruned. go.config.repo.gc.check.interval 28800000   in milliseconds Frequency of checking for loose object count, specified in milliseconds with default set to 8 hours.

Fan-in material resolution will ensure that a pipeline triggers only when all its upstream pipelines have triggered off the same version of an ancestor pipeline or material. This will be the case when you have multiple components building in separate pipelines which all have the same ancestor and you want downstream pipelines to all use the same version of the artifact from the ancestor pipeline. When you have non trivial pipeline dependency graphs, significant differences in pipeline execution times and automatic builds/deployments, you may typically run into the following issues Wasted builds : Premature runs which do not have the right version of dependent components because one of the dependent pipelines was faster than the rest. Inconsistent results : Your deployment that depends on multiple components may have incompatible versions of components because the build times of these components are different Incorrect feedback : Your deployment to Production should happen only when it has successfully passed the UAT, Staging and Pre-Prod environments but it was triggered prematurely as soon as UAT went green. Running code with the wrong tests : Your commit to SCM contains both code and tests written for the code. Your pipelines are modeled such that your acceptance or test pipeline runs after the build pipeline. Acceptance has to run with the right tests for the code but instead it triggers as soon as the commit goes through with the previous available version for tests. GoCD helps solve all of the above problems. How to use fan-in: In cases where your SCM material is used throughout the process you will need to define the same URL for the material throughout. This will let GoCD know that it is a shared material and GoCD will enforce fan-in wherever applicable. For example: code, tests, environment configuration are in http://svn.company.com/code, http://svn.company.com/tests, and http://svn.company.com/config respectively. In this case ensure for pipelines that need these materials, the url is set to the same value. For example the pipelines Build, Acceptance and Deploy have the material url http://svn.company.com Pipelines where fan-in dependency resolution is required will need to have trigger type set as auto Example use cases for fan-in resolution Creating a gate to production I want to push a build into a number of environments in parallel  Manual QA, UAT for business sign off and performance testing  so that all these activities happen at the same time. So we have a pipeline dependency model as shown below For the next step, when deploying to production, we have a pipeline that depends on all 3 of the above pipeline so that a build that has succeeded in all 3 environments is automatically pushed to production. This is shown below. Sequence of Events and Resolution A new build is generated. The build is pushed to QA, UAT and performance pipelines. Regardless of the time taken in each of these pipelines, GoCD will ensure that production is triggered only after all three pipelines go green with the same version of build. Production will use the right version of your build artifacts. How to configure: Production should have trigger type as auto. QA, UAT and Performance should have Build as a material. Trigger type for these pipelines can be either manual or auto. Picking the right version of dependent components I have three component pipelines  C1, C2, C3  and a package pipeline that fetches their artifacts and creates a deploy package. Components C2 and C3 depend on pipeline C1 and have it as a material. The pipeline for C2 builds quickly but C3 takes a while. So we have a pipeline dependency model as shown below The package pipeline should not trigger as soon as C2 is done. It should trigger only if both C2 and C3 go green. Additionally Package should use the same version of C1 that was used by C2 and C3. Sequence of Events and Resolution C1 is triggered on a change. C2 and C3 are triggered after C1 is successful. C2 builds quickly but C3 is still in Progress. Go resolves that C3 and C2 depend on a common ancestor C1. Hence GoCD will wait for C3 to finish. If C3 goes green, the Package pipeline will trigger. It will use the right versions of C1, C2 and C3. How to configure: Add C1 as a material for pipelines C2 and C3 Add C2 and C3 as materials for pipeline Package. Package should have trigger type as auto Test source code with the right version of tests You check-in code and tests as part of the same commit. The build pipeline compiles code and creates an artifact. The Acceptance pipeline fetches the build artifact and runs the tests that were written for the compiled code. Acceptance has to use the same tests committed with the code. So we have a pipeline dependency model as shown below Sequence of Events and Resolution On committing the changes, the Build pipeline will trigger with the latest revision. Although Acceptance also has the same material dependency, GoCD will not trigger it immediately. Build pipeline executes successfully. Acceptance will now trigger with the same version of the SCM and fetch the right build artifact from the Build pipeline. How to configure: Add the same SCM material to pipelines Build and Acceptance i.e the same URL. Pipelines Build and Acceptance have trigger type as auto. Limitations Fan-in and blacklist : If the pipelines contributing to the fan-in have blacklist in their material definitions, the target pipeline does not adhere to fan-in behavior. For example, refer to the scenario above. P1 and P2 are two pipelines which use the same mercurial  hg  repository, with two folders say \"p1\" and \"p2\". P1 is configured with \"p2\" folder in the blacklist. Likewise P2 is configured with \"p1\" folder in the blacklist. The first run of P1 happens when a check-in happens in \"p1\" folder. The first run of P2 happens when there is a check-in to \"p2\". In this scenario, P3, which is dependant on P1 and P2 does not trigger. Notes Fan-in as a feature is enabled by default. In case you need pipelines to trigger with every version regardless of ancestor versions you can disable fan-in. To disable fan-in you will need to set the system property resolve.fanin.revisions to false and restart the GoCD server. To configure the system properties, edit the file wrapper-properties.conf on the GoCD server to add the system properties described above. See the installation documentation for the location of wrapper-properties.conf file. GoCD will apply fan-in dependency resolution for pipelines that have auto trigger type only."},{"title":"Logging","href":"/advanced_usage/logging.html","content":"Logging Introduction You can turn on additional logging to diagnose and troubleshoot issues with the GoCD server and agent.

The GoCD system includes a lot of internal subsystems and processes, which continuously do work. Some examples include the material subsystem which takes care of polling for materials, the scheduling subsystem which automatically starts pipelines and stages, the agent subsystem which continuously keeps tracks of agent states and provides them jobs to run, etc. Maintenance mode is a maintenance mode which can be utilized by the GoCD system administrator to safely restart or upgrade the GoCD server without having any running jobs reschedule when the server is back up. The maintenance mode implementation: Stops the material subsystem so that no new materials are polled. Waits for currently polling materials to finish. Does not allow pipelines-as-code repositories to be polled. Stops the scheduling subsystem so that no new pipelines are triggered  automatically or through timers . Prevents users from triggering pipelines. Prevents users from modifying config. Prevents users from almost all activity which can modify state in the database or filesystem. Stops the agent subsystem, so that no agents can pick up work if they're idle. Allows all agents currently busy running jobs to finish. Provides a single location to put GoCD into or bring it out of maintenance mode. Provides a single location to see the status of all the subsystems, when in maintenance mode. Provides an API call to put GoCD into or bring it out of maintenance mode. Shows state of materials which are being polled currently. Shows state of agents which are currently running jobs. Shows a banner near the footer of all pages which tells everyone that the server is in maintenance mode. Indicate when a server is safe to restart or upgrade  finished maintenanceing . In Progress Maintenance Mode: After initiating maintenance mode, several sub-systems of GoCD might still be in progress. Example: scheduled jobs, building jobs, material updates, etc. In such cases, GoCD Administrators can choose to cancel building, scheduled jobs or wait for there completion. Cancelling in-progress material updates might cause repository corruption due to partial clone and have side effects on pipeline scheduling. Hence, GoCD does not allow cancellation of MDUs even during maintenance mode. GoCD administrators should wait until all material updates are completed. Maintenance Mode Completion: After all the sub-systems of GoCD are stopped during maintenance mode, GoCD server can be considered completely maintenanceed and is ready for a restart or an upgrade. NOTE: Upon a restart, the GoCD server will no longer be in maintenance mode and will start all subsystems.

Note: GoCD will be unusable during the backup process. Backup time is proportional to the database and configuration size. We suggest you backup GoCD when the GoCD Server is idle. Users who are logged into the GoCD Dashboard will be redirected to a maintenance page during the backup. On backup completion they will be redirected to the page they were on. If you are using PostgreSQL Addon please refer to our documentation here for back and restore process. What is backed up? The backup will be performed into the ${ARTIFACT_REPOSITORY_LOCATION}/serverBackups directory. ${ARTIFACT_REPOSITORY_LOCATION} for your server can be found as mentioned here. The backup directory will be named backup_{TIMESTAMP} where the ${TIMESTAMP} is the time when the backup was initiated. Database - This is in a zip called db.zip . The zip has a single DB file called cruise.h2.db Configuration - This is in a zip called config-dir.zip . This zip contains the XML configuration, Jetty server configuration, Keystores and all other GoCD's internal configurations. Wrapper Configuration - This is in a zip called wrapper-config-dir.zip . This zip contains configuration files for startup properties for the server. XML Configuration Version Repo - This is in a zip called config-repo.zip . This zip contains the Git repository of the XML configuration file. GoCD version - This is a file called version.txt . This file contains the version of the GoCD server when the backup was initiated What is not backed up? The following are not backed up as a part of the GoCD backup process. Please ensure that these are manually backed up regularly. Artifacts - Please refer to this section to find out how to deal with artifacts Log Files Plugins - These are found at ${SERVER_INSTALLATION_DIR}/plugins/. This contains both the external and bundled plugins. Addons - These are found at ${SERVER_INSTALLATION_DIR}/addons/. This contains installed addons. Strategy to backup Artifacts and Test Reporting Data Artifacts and the Test Reporting Data keep getting new files and directories added to them. So, it is a good idea to use rsync to copy the contents of these two into a backup location. For Instance: Lets say you have a copy of all the files till 12-02-2012 in a location. On 20-02-2012, you can do something like: rsync -avzP ${ARTIFACT_LOCATION} ${BACKUP_LOCATION} This makes sure that only the files and directories that got newly added will be synced to the ${BACKUP_LOCATION} and not the entire contents. Restoring GoCD using backup The restoration process is not automated and needs to be done manually. Please refer to the previous sections about the contents of the backup. Steps to restore In order to restore the GoCD server from a backup, the server must first be stopped. Make sure the process is completely dead before starting the restoration. Choose the backup directory that you want to restore from. Note: Please ensure that you are not restoring a GoCD backup onto a GoCD version that is older than the one that was used to perform the backup. For example: A backup using GoCD version 19.3 cannot be restored onto GoCD version 19.2. See the file version.txt in the backup directory to know the version of GoCD that was used to perform the backup Database - Unzip the db.zip found in the backup directory. Unzip will create a file called cruise.h2.db . Copy this file to the directory ${SERVER_INSTALLATION_DIR}/db/h2db . Configuration - Unzip the config-dir.zip into a temp directory.

These will typically need to be set before the start of the GoCD Server, unless specified. System properties If an option specified below is of type \"System property\", then it will be a Java system property, which needs to be provided to the GoCD Server, typically prefixed with -D unless otherwise stated. So, if the property is called my.new.property and the value that needs to be set is true, then the Java system property to be used will be -Dmy.new.property=true. Notice the lack of a space between the -D and the property name. To configure the system properties, edit the file wrapper-properties.conf on the GoCD server. See the installation documentation for the location of wrapper-properties.conf file. Options cruise.listen.host - The host that the GoCD Server should bind to Name: cruise.listen.host Type: System property Restrictions: Should be a valid, bind-able IP address The GoCD Server opens a listening socket, so that it can serve pages to users and GoCD Agents. It needs to listen on a specific host. This host determines which clients  users as well as GoCD Agents  can access the GoCD Server. By default, the server listens on 0.0.0.0, which is the wildcard or \"unspecified\" address. Usually, this means that the GoCD Server can be accessed through any network interface. In some, more advanced networking setups, it might be needed to override this, typically to 127.0.0.1, so that only clients local to the box can access it. cruise.server.port - HTTP port for the Go Server Name: cruise.server.port Type: System property Restrictions: Should be the number of a valid port that is not used by another process Similar to the cruise.listen.host property, the value of this property determines which port the Go Server binds to, and accepts HTTP connections from. If not overridden, it is set to 8153. cruise.server.ssl.port - HTTPS port for the Go Server Name: cruise.server.ssl.port Type: System property Restrictions: Should be the number of a valid port that is not used by another process Similar to the cruise.listen.host property, the value of this property determines which port the Go Server binds to, and accepts HTTPS connections from. If not overridden, it is set to 8154. cruise.config.dir - Location of the configuration files Name: cruise.config.dir Type: System property Restrictions: Should be the directory, writeable by the Go Server process Though not used often, this property can be used to change the location of the Go Server's config directory. Changing this could have an impact on the ability to upgrade the Go Server, and so, it's not recommended to change this. go.spa.refresh.interval - GoCD SPA pages refresh interval time Name: go.spa.refresh.interval Type: System property Restrictions: Should be the time duration specified in milliseconds Default: 10000 The GoCD pages are refreshed periodically to ensure they have upto date information. This property can be used to change the time interval at which these GoCD pages should be refreshed. Setting this to a lower value  <= 5000  could have a performance impact on the GoCD server. go.spa.timeout\t - GoCD SPA pages request timeout Name: go.spa.timeout Type: System property Restrictions: Should be the time duration specified in milliseconds Default: 60000 This property can be used to change the timeout value of AJAX requests made from the GoCD pages.

This way, you can keep your pipeline definitions out of GoCD and under version control, and manage them externally. A poller in the GoCD server will check periodically for modifications to your external pipeline definitions, and merge them with the pipeline data already present in GoCD's main XML configuration file. For a quick overview of this feature, see this video. Pipelines as code is an optional feature. Any existing config in any GoCD server will remain valid. Pipelines as code allows GoCD to monitor and merge in external pipeline definitions located in multiple \"config repositories\". Pipelines from a config repository may depend on a pipeline defined in GoCD's main XML configuration file. Pipelines as code is exposed as a plugin endpoint, and so, you can write a plugin for a config repository to store pipeline configuration data in any manner you choose. The following diagram shows how GoCD combines pipeline configuration data from multiple sources: A note about \"Infrastructure as code\" \"Infrastructure as code\" is often equated exclusively to checking in configuration data to a source code repository. However, GoCD has always allowed configuration through code in various forms. For instance, gomatic, using GoCD APIs, yagocd, gocd-cli, and more. Pipelines as code is simply one more option. It makes pipeline definition more declarative, depending on the plugin, and may give more control to external mantainers. Available plugins for storing pipelines as code JSON and YAML are the two formats supported currently. Refer to JSON file configuration and YAML file configuration for more information about the file format. The config repositories page  Admin → Config Repositories  lists existing config repositories, and allows CRUD  Create-Read-Update-Delete  operations on them. This page also shows errors and allows you to request a check of a config repository. Pipeline configuration in JSON To tell GoCD where to find the pipeline configuration files: Start the server Go to \"Admin → Config repositories\" Click on the \"Add\" button at the top right corner Select \"JSON configuration Plugin\" as the plugin ID Once you've added a config repository, you'll see new pipelines in the pipeline dashboard.

Access to a windowing environment is usually required for testing UI applications or for driving browsers for web testing. Here's how you do it. Windows The first step is to disable the GoCD agent service. To do this: Log in to your Windows machine as an Administrative user. Click on Start → Control Panel → Administrative Tools → Services. Double click on 'Go Agent'. Change the Startup Type to 'Disabled'. Click 'Stop' to stop the service. Click 'OK' to finish. The next step is to start the GoCD agent as an application. Click on Start → All Programs → Go Agent → Run Go Agent. To get the GoCD agent to start every time you log in, copy the Run Go Agent shortcut to the Startup folder of your start menu. Linux There are many different ways to get a Linux build agent to interact with a UI. The easiest is to use a VNC service  or xvfb  to provide a dedicated X11 server to your agent. To do this: Install the VNC server and fvwm packages for your distribution.  aptitude install vnc4server fvwm / yum install vnc-server fvwm Sudo to the 'go' user  sudo su - go  and do the rest as that user Set a password for remote access to your VNC server with the command 'vncpasswd' Edit your VNC config to use fvwm and not twm as the window manager.  replace twm with fvwm in ~/.vnc/xstartup Edit the file wrapper-properties.conf and set the DISPLAY variable to an appropriate value. Restart your agent and it will now have access to an X11 server that you can also connect to with your favourite VNC client. If there are any other environment variables that need to be set for your UI testing tools, they correct place to set these is in your wrapper-properties.conf file. Don't forget to export them! You can connect to your session with vncviewer to see what's going on.

If a pipeline is locked then GoCD will not allow any other instance of that pipeline to be scheduled until the currently running one has been completed. To enable locking from the Config UI, navigate to the Pipeline Settings section of a pipeline. There are three options for locking: Option 1: Run single instance of pipeline at a time  \"Lock behavior: Unlock when finished\" This option enables a single instance of the pipeline to run at a time by temporarily locking the pipeline and unlocking it when finished. When the pipeline finishes, either because of the failure of any stage or the success of the final stage, the pipeline is automatically unlocked. The pipeline is also unlocked if it reaches a manual stage. Option 2: Run single instance of pipeline and lock on failure  \"Lock behavior: Lock on failure\" This option enables a single instance of the pipeline to run at a time.

Timers understand a cron-like specification for when to run a pipeline. Note that a pipeline will still schedule normally if changes are checked in. If the pipeline should only run according to the timer's schedule then you should also set a manual approval for the first stage of the pipeline to stop it from automatically scheduling when materials change. This can be also be achieved by un-checking the option \"Automatic pipeline scheduling\" shown in the screenshot below. The timer is similar to a manually triggered pipeline in many ways. But it does not fetch the latest revision of the materials when it runs. It uses the last available revision that it knows of. Configure through the UI To configure the timer in the UI, navigate to the General Options section of the pipeline. For example, a timer that is configured as shown in the screenshot would run the pipeline at 10pm on weekdays. An option called \"Run only on new material\" is also available in this form. Selecting this option ensures that the pipeline will get triggered on the specified schedule only if materials have changed since the last run of this pipeline. For example, if there are no new commits since the last run, future runs will be skipped until new commits or until the pipeline is forced to run  using trigger-with-options  with an older commit.

Attributes Attribute Required Description artifactsdir No This directory is where Go will store its information, including artifacts published by jobs. The default value is 'artifacts' in the folder where the Go Server is installed. You can use an absolute path or a relative path which will take the server installed directory as the root. Notes: If you specify the attribute, please check whether Go has permission to access that directory. Also you should be aware of that changing this value while Go Server is running won't take effect until Go Server is restarted. siteUrl No This entry will be used by Go Server to generate links for emails, feeds etc., where we cannot have relative URLs. For example, if you have fronted Go with a reverse proxy, this value should be the base URL for the proxy and not the internal Go address. For this reason, it is necessary to specify this configuration. Format: [protocol]://[host]:[port]. You need to define the [port] in case Go uses a non-standard port. secureSiteUrl No Certain features in Go require an HTTPS SSL  endpoint. If you wish that your primary site URL be HTTP, but still want to have HTTPS endpoints for the features that require SSL, you can specify the secureSiteUrl attribute with a value of the base HTTPS URL. Format: https://[host]:[port]. You need to define the [port] in case Go uses a non-standard port. purgeStart No Go can purge old artifacts when available disk space on the server is low. Go will begin to purge artifacts when disk space is lower than 'purgeStart' GB. Artifacts will never be deleted if 'purgeStart' and 'purgeUpto' are not defined. purgeUpto No Go can purge old artifacts when available disk space on the server is low. Go will purge artifacts till available disk space is greater than 'purgeUpto' GB. This attribute must be defined if purgeStart is defined. jobTimeout No This entry will be used as the default timeout value for hung jobs. A job is considered as hung if it does not generate any console output for \"jobTimeout\" minutes. If the attribute is not specified jobTimeout defaults to 60 minutes. commandRepositoryLocation Yes  auto-generated Specifies the location of the command repository relative to go-server_install_root/db/command_repository. The bundled repository is in a directory named default. serverId Yes  auto-generated This value uniquely identifies a Go server installation. It may be used by features that require unique names/identifiers across different Go server installations. This attribute need not be specified for a new server. In case no value is given, server auto-generates a random UUID an assigns it as serverId. This value should never be changed for an existing server. Administrator should clear this attribute before copying configuration to a different installation. agentAutoRegisterKey No The key specified here is used by agents for auto-registration. Notes: If both siteUrl and secureSiteUrl are not defined, Go URLs will use the default domain which in most cases will be http://your-go-server:8153 If only siteUrl is defined and is not HTTPS, Go URLs will be composed from the siteUrl entry. In this case, the secure pages of Go will not be navigable. If only siteUrl is defined and is HTTPS, Go URLs will be composed from the siteUrl entry and all pages will be HTTPS. If only secureSiteUrl is defined, Go URLs will use the default domain for non-HTTPS pages, while HTTPs pages will be composed from the secureSiteUrl entry. If purgeStart and purgeUpto are not defined, artifacts will never be deleted. Examples       top <security> {#security} The `` element can be used to enable authentication. If the element is not defined anyone can use Go without logging in. We currently support enabling authentication using Authorization plugin endpoint. Support for LDAP and simple password-file authentication is available out of box via the bundled plugins for the same. You can use more than one authentication mechanism if you want. Support for inbuilt LDAP and password file tags in configuration has been deprecated. Examples                                Url          ldap://xxx.yourcompany.com                          ManagerDN          cn=Acitivity Directory LDap User,ou=InformationSystems,ou=SharedAccounts,ou=Principal,dc=xxxx,dc=yyyy,dc=com                          Password          secret                          SearchBases          ou=Employees,ou=Enterprise,ou=Principal,dc=xxxx,dc=yyyy,dc=com                          UserLoginFilter           sAMAccountName={0}                          UserSearchFilter           sAMAccountName={0}                          DisplayNameAttribute          displayName                          EmailAttribute          mail                      top <mailhost> {#mailhost} The `` element is used to configure mail notifications. Mail notifications require security to be enabled. Attribute Required Description hostname Yes The SMTP mail server which Go will use to send email. For example, hostname=\"mailhost.yourcompany.com\" port Yes The mail port to use. Typically this will be the default mail port of 25. username Yes The username which Go should use to login to the mail host. password Yes The password to access the mailhost. tls No Use TLS Transport Layer Security  or not. The default value is 'false'. Use 'true' to enable TLS security. from Yes Go will attempt to set this email address as the 'from' address for email that it sends. Note that this setting may not be honoured by the SMTP server that you use. For example, from=\"go-admin@yourcompany.com\". admin Yes Go admintrator's email address. Go will send diagnostic messages to this email address. For example, Go will send a warning message if it is running out of disk space. Examples top <backup> {#backup} The `` element is used to configure backups. Attribute Required Description schedule No The cron-like specification to perform a backup. postBackupScript No A script that will be invoked on the GoCD server after backup is performed  successfully, or otherwise . See cron backups for details about this script. emailOnSuccess No Boolean indicating whether email should be sent on a successful backup. Requires that mailhost config be setup. emailOnFailure No Boolean indicating whether email should be sent on a failed backup backup. Requires that mailhost config be setup. Examples For example: to perform a backup once a night at 10pm on weekdays and call the /usr/local/bin/upload-to-s3 script after the backup is done.      ... Go uses the Quartz scheduler internally. For convenience we reproduce the Quartz cron documentation here: Format A cron expression is a string comprised of 6 or 7 fields separated by white space. Fields can contain any of the allowed values, along with various combinations of the allowed special characters for that field. The fields are as follows: Field Name Mandatory? Allowed Values Allowed Special Characters Seconds YES 0-59 , - * / Minutes YES 0-59 , - * / Hours YES 0-23 , - * / Day of month YES 1-31 , - * ? / L W\\ Month YES 1-12 or JAN-DEC , - * / Day of week YES 1-7 or SUN-SAT , - * ? / L # Year NO empty, 1970-2099 , - * / So cron expressions can be as simple as this: * * * * * ? or more complex, like this: 0 15 10 ? * 6L 2002-2005 Special characters *  \"all values\"  - used to select all values within a field. For example, \"*\" in the minute field means \"every minute\". ?  \"no specific value\"  - useful when you need to specify something in one of the two fields in which the character is allowed, but not the other. For example, if I want my trigger to fire on a particular day of the month  say, the 10th , but don't care what day of the week that happens to be, I would put \"10\" in the day-of-month field, and \"?\" in the day-of-week field. See the examples below for clarification. - - used to specify ranges. For example, \"10-12\" in the hour field means \"the hours 10, 11 and 12\". , - used to specify additional values. For example, \"MON,WED,FRI\" in the day-of-week field means \"the days Monday, Wednesday, and Friday\". / - used to specify increments. For example, \"0/15\" in the seconds field means \"the seconds 0, 15, 30, and 45\". And \"5/15\" in the seconds field means \"the seconds 5, 20, 35, and 50\". You can also specify '/' after the '' character - in this case '' is equivalent to having '0' before the '/'. '1/3' in the day-of-month field means \"fire every 3 days starting on the first day of the month\". L  \"last\"  - has different meaning in each of the two fields in which it is allowed. For example, the value \"L\" in the day-of-month field means \"the last day of the month\" - day 31 for January, day 28 for February on non-leap years. If used in the day-of-week field by itself, it simply means \"7\" or \"SAT\". But if used in the day-of-week field after another value, it means \"the last xxx day of the month\" - for example \"6L\" means \"the last friday of the month\". When using the 'L' option, it is important not to specify lists, or ranges of values, as you'll get confusing results. W  \"weekday\"  - used to specify the weekday  Monday-Friday  nearest the given day. As an example, if you were to specify \"15W\" as the value for the day-of-month field, the meaning is: \"the nearest weekday to the 15th of the month\". So if the 15th is a Saturday, the trigger will fire on Friday the 14th. If the 15th is a Sunday, the trigger will fire on Monday the 16th. If the 15th is a Tuesday, then it will fire on Tuesday the 15th. However if you specify \"1W\" as the value for day-of-month, and the 1st is a Saturday, the trigger will fire on Monday the 3rd, as it will not 'jump' over the boundary of a month's days. The 'W' character can only be specified when the day-of-month is a single day, not a range or list of days. The 'L' and 'W' characters can also be combined in the day-of-month field to yield 'LW', which translates to \"last weekday of the month\". # - used to specify \"the nth\" XXX day of the month. For example, the value of \"6#3\" in the day-of-week field means \"the third Friday of the month\"  day 6 = Friday and \"#3\" = the 3rd one in the month . Other examples: \"2#1\" = the first Monday of the month and \"4#5\" = the fifth Wednesday of the month. Note that if you specify \"#5\" and there is not 5 of the given day-of-week in the month, then no firing will occur that month. The legal characters and the names of months and days of the week are not case sensitive. MON is the same as mon. Examples Here are some full examples: Expression Meaning 0 0 12 * * ? Fire at 12pm  noon  every day 0 15 10 ? * * Fire at 10:15am every day 0 15 10 * * ? Fire at 10:15am every day 0 15 10 * * ? * Fire at 10:15am every day 0 15 10 * * ? 2005 Fire at 10:15am every day during the year 2005 0 * 14 * * ?

Fire every 5 minutes starting at 2pm and ending at 2:55pm, AND fire every 5 minutes starting at 6pm and ending at 6:55pm, every day 0 0-5 14 * * ? Fire every minute starting at 2pm and ending at 2:05pm, every day 0 10,44 14 ? 3 WED Fire at 2:10pm and at 2:44pm every Wednesday in the month of March. 0 15 10 ? * MON-FRI Fire at 10:15am every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday 0 15 10 15 * ? Fire at 10:15am on the 15th day of every month 0 15 10 L * ? Fire at 10:15am on the last day of every month 0 15 10 ? * 6L Fire at 10:15am on the last Friday of every month 0 15 10 ? * 6L Fire at 10:15am on the last Friday of every month 0 15 10 ? * 6L 2002-2005 Fire at 10:15am on every last friday of every month during the years 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005 0 15 10 ? * 6#3 Fire at 10:15am on the third Friday of every month 0 0 12 1/5 * ? Fire at 12pm  noon  every 5 days every month, starting on the first day of the month. 0 11 11 11 11 ? Fire every November 11th at 11:11am. Pay attention to the effects of '?' and '*' in the day-of-week and day-of-month fields! Notes Support for specifying both a day-of-week and a day-of-month value is not complete  you must currently use the '?' character in one of these fields . Be careful when setting fire times between mid-night and 1:00 AM - \"daylight savings\" can cause a skip or a repeat depending on whether the time moves back or jumps forward. top <ldap> {#ldap} [Deprecated] The `` element is used to specify the ldap server. Users can access Go with their username and password from this ldap server. Attributes Attribute Required Description uri Yes uri for the ldap server. For example, uri=\"ldap://ldap.yourcompany.com\" managerDn Yes For example, managerDn=\"cn=Active Directory Ldap User,ou=InformationSystems,ou=SharedAccounts,ou=Principal,dc=xxxxx,dc=yyyy,dc=com\" managerPassword Yes Go will connect to the LDAP server with this password searchFilter No e.g. searchFilter=\" sAMAccountName={0} \" Examples                                       Jez       lqiao                go-admin     lqiao    top <bases> {#bases} The `` element is used to specify a list of search bases  the distinguished name of the search base object  which defines the location in the directory from which the LDAP search begins. top <base> {#base} The `` element is used to specify a search base  the distinguished name of the search base object  defines the location in the directory from which the LDAP search begins. Attribute Required Description value Yes The search base.                         top <passwordFile> {#passwordFile} [Deprecated] The `` element is used to specify a file which has a set of username and password pairs. The format of username and password in this file is ${username}=${password which has been encrypted with SHA1}, with one line per user. Attribute Required Description path Yes The absolute path of the password file. Examples Suppose the password file is admins.properties, which is located in /home/go. You want to create two users as Administrators: one username is Jez, the password encrypted with SHA1 is ThmbShxAtJepX80c2JY1FzOEmUk= the other one is lqiao, the password encrypted with SHA1 is TfkgShslgJepX80c2JY1trwEskT= The configuration could look like:    The username and password could be set in admins.properties as follows: Jez=ThmbShxAtJepX80c2JY1FzOEmUk lqiao=TfkgShslgJepX80c2JY1trwEskT top <authConfigs> {#authConfigs} Using `` element GoCD administrators can provide one or more authorization configurations to connect with the authorization server s . Example          ...               ...      top <authConfig> {#authConfig} The `` specifies the configuration to be used by the authorization plugin. This will usually allow administrators to configure the connection settings for your authorization plugin, and may include configuration like URLs and credentials, among others. An authConfig should have a unique id attribute and should be associated to plugin through the pluginId attribute. Attributes Attribute Required Description id Yes Unique Id of authConfig. pluginId Yes The Id of authorization plugin. allowOnlyKnownUsersToLogin No Allow only those users to login who have been explicitly added by an admin. If false, any new user who tries to login and is present in your password file or LDAP will be automatically created as a Go user.  Default=false Refer to your plugin's documentation to know the property keys to be configured. Example:        PasswordFilePath     /etc/go/password.properties    top <roles> {#roles} The element is a container for roles that users defined. It can't be defined without. Examples   ...               Jez       lqiao         top <role> {#role_definition} The element is used to define a group of users who perform similar tasks. Optionally, the element can specify a policy which defines the permission model for the users defined as part of the current role. In a element, Users are added by adding the sub-tag [] #usersinrole  and Policy is added by adding the sub-tag ``. Notes: If you want to define roles, you must define an authentication method, either ] #ldap  or [. These roles are not associated with roles defined in LDAP; they only work within Go. For example, you can assign a role to the manual-approval in a stage, so that only the users in that role can approve the stage to run. Attribute Required Description name Yes The name of the role. Examples Two users would be in the role 'environment-operators', they are Jez and lqiao have access to administer all the environments expect environments matching prod_* name.                 prod_*         *                 Jez       lqiao         top <users> {#usersinrole} List of users in a role. top One `` element defines a particular user in a role. You can add as many as you like. <user> {#userinrole} One `` element defines a particular user in a role. You can add as many as you like. Notes: The user must be in your LDAP or passwordFile. Examples Two users would be in the role 'pipeline-operators', they are Jez and lqiao.        Jez     lqiao    <policy> {#policyinrole} The `` element defines the permissions for the users belonging to the users of a role. In a element, the *allow* permission can added by adding the sub-tag [] #allow_permission_in_policy  and deny permission can be added by adding the sub-tag ``. Examples The following policy would grant users the permissions to administer to all environments expect environments matching prod_* name.     prod_*     * <allow> {#allow_permission_in_policy} The `` element under policy grants permissions to the defined GoCD entity based on the type, action and resource. The value of the allow element defines the resource on which policy should be applied. Notes: Attribute Required Description type Yes The type of the GoCD entity to grant permissions on. The supported values for type are environment and config_repo. action Yes The operation that can be performed on the GoCD entity. The supported values for action are administer and view. Examples The following policy would grant users the permissions to administer to all environments matching prod_* name.     prod_* An administrator can use * to provide allow access of all type and action. Examples      * <deny> {#deny_permission_in_policy} The `` element under policy deny the access to the defined GoCD entity based on the type, action and resource. The value of the deny element defines the resource on which policy should be applied. Notes: Attribute Required Description type Yes The type of the GoCD entity to deny the access on. The supported values for type are environment and config_repo. action Yes The operation that can not be performed on the GoCD entity. The supported values for action are administer and view. Examples The following policy would deny the administer access to all environments matching prod_* name.     prod_* An administrator can use * to deny all the access of all type and action. Examples      * top <pluginRole> {#plugin_role_definition} The `` element is used to define roles in GoCD. Unlike role which contains a list of users, pluginRole provides configuration to map a GoCD role to a role defined in an external authorization server managed by an Authorization plugin. e.g pluginRole can be used to define mappings between LDAP group and GoCD roles. Optionally, the `` element can specify a policy which defines the permission model for the users of the current role. Notes: Attribute Required Description name Yes The name of the role. authConfigId Yes Id of an authorization config. Refer to your plugin's documentation to know the property keys to be configured for the pluginRole. Examples        prod_*     *           MemberOfAttribute     memberOf           MatchingGroups     CN=Dev,OU=Groups,DC=some,DC=enterprise,DC=com    top <admins> {#admins} The `` element specifies which users are administrators. Only administrators can open the Administration tab to maintain Go Configuration. Administrators can perform all functions in Go  including triggering pipelines, deploying to environments etc. Notes: The user must be in your LDAP or passwordFile. Examples   ...        go-admin     lqiao    top <role> {#roleinadmin} One element in [] #admins  is used to specify a group as administrators. You can add as many as you like. Notes: The role must refer to ``. Examples The users in role 'go-admin' would be administrators.   go-admin   lqiao top <user> {#user} Notes: The user must be in your LDAP or passwordFile. Examples Two users would be administrators, they are Jez and lqiao.   Jez   lqiao top <role> {#role} Notes: The role must be defined in ``. Examples    lqiao    _readonly_member <elastic> {#elastic} The `` element is used to provide configurations for the elastic agents. Attribute Required Description jobStarvationTimeout No Timeout in minutes. If a job that requires an elastic agent is not assigned within the specified period, the elastic agent plugin will be notified to create a new elastic agent. Examples               ...         top <agentProfiles> {#agentProfiles} `` element specifies the profiles to configure elastic agents. There can be zero or more profiles. Examples        ...    top <agentProfile> {#agentProfile} `` specifies the configuration to be used to create an elastic-agent instance. A profile should have a unique id attribute, should be associated with a cluster via clusterProfileId attribute and with plugin through the pluginId attribute. Attributes Attribute Required Description id Yes Unique Id of profile. pluginId Yes The Id of elastic-agent plugin. clusterProfileId Yes The Id of cluster profile. Example:        ami-id     ami-6ac7408f           region     us-east-1    top <clusterProfiles> {#clusterProfiles} `` element specifies the profiles to configure clusters. There can be zero or more cluster profile. Examples        ...    top <clusterProfile> {#clusterProfile} `` specifies the configuration to be used to to create/manage a cluster. A cluster profile should have a unique id attribute and should be associated to plugin through the pluginId attribute. Attributes Attribute Required Description id Yes Unique Id of cluster profile. pluginId Yes The Id of elastic-agent plugin. Example:        GoServerUrl     https://your-server-host:8154/go           ClusterName     Cluster    top <config-repos> {#config-repos} The element is a container of many. Example   ...                                                           file_pattern           **/*.gocd.yaml                         top <config-repo> {#config-repo} The `` element specifies a single configuration repository. It must contain exactly one SCM material and may contain additional configuration section. Attributes Attribute Required Description pluginId Yes The ID of configuration repository plugin. E.g. json.config.plugin. id Yes The ID of the configuration repository. ID must be a unique alphanumeric string. It can also contain -,_,.. Example     ...                                                      file_pattern             **/*.gocd.yaml                               <configuration> {#config-repo-configuration} The `` element is optional part of config repo definition. Keys and values are specified and handled by particular plugin. This section can be used to customize how config repo plugin works when parsing this specific repository. #Example        file_pattern     *.go.yaml           allowed_pipelines_regex     project-X-.*    top <svn> {#config-repo-svn} The config repo `` material element specifies the location of your code base in Subversion repository. Attributes Attribute Required Description url Yes URL for the remote repository. Go supports the following protocols for subversion: http, https, svn and svn+ssh, but does not support 'file:///'. username No The user account for the remote repository. password No The password for the specified user encryptedPassword No The encrypted password for the specified user checkexternals No The default value is false, the value should be either one of true/false or 1/0. 'true' or '1' means that the changes of externals will be included as part of configuration. materialName No The name to identify a material. Material name can contain the following characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, fullstop, underscore and hyphen, but whitespace is not allowed. A material name is case insensitive and starting with fullstop is invalid. The max length is 255 characters. autoUpdate No By default Go polls the repository for changes automatically. If autoUpdate is set to false then Go will not poll the repository for changes. For config repo materials, autoUpdate is always set to true. Notes: Go cannot automatically accept svn SSL certificates. If you are using https for svn repository, you have to go to the Server, and as the user 'go' do a command \"svn update\" to store the certificates in the cache permanently. Examples:      top <hg> {#config-repo-hg} The config repo `` material element specifies the location of your code base in a Mercurial repository. Go supports the following protocols for Mercurial: http, ssh. Notes: You must install Mercurial 1.5 or above on the Go Server. Go does not ship with Mercurial. Attributes Attribute Required Description url Yes URL to fetch source code from the Mercurial repository. If you specify the username and password for the Mercurial repository, you should put them into the url. Mercurial supports an optional identifier after # in the url, which indicates a particular branch, tag or changeset. This option can be used to configure mercurial branches in Go. materialName No The name to identify a material. Material name can contain the following characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, fullstop, underscore and hyphen. Spaces are not allowed. Material name is case insensitive. The max length is 255 characters. autoUpdate No By default Go polls the repository for changes automatically. If autoUpdate is set to false then Go will not poll the repository for changes. For config repo materials, autoUpdate is always set to true. Examples      #Specifying a mercurial branch.      Note: Do not use configrepo material type for config-repo pipeline material configuration when using mercurial branch as it will result in merge error. top <p4> {#config-repo-p4} The config repo `` material element specifies the location of your code base in a Perforce repository. Attributes Attribute Required Description port Yes Perforce server connection to use  host:port . This is the same as you would pass in the p4port parameter for the p4 command line or in the P4PORT environment variable. username No Perforce username to use. password No Password for the specified user. encryptedPassword No Encrypted Password for the specified user. useTickets No Set to true to work with perforce tickets. Go will do a p4 login using the supplied password before each command. We recommend that you make your user a part of a p4 group, and set the ticket timeout to unlimited as described here. view Yes Valid Perforce view. The view should be a sub-element of P4. Click here to see details about VIEW of Perforce. materialName No The name to identify a material. Material name can contain the following characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, fullstop, underscore and hyphen. Spaces are not allowed. Material name is case insensitive. The max length is 255 characters. autoUpdate No By default Go polls the repository for changes automatically. If autoUpdate is set to false then Go will not poll the repository for changes. For config repo materials, autoUpdate is always set to true. Notes: Views consist of multiple mappings. Each mapping has two parts: The left-hand side specifies one or more files in the depot and has the form: //depotname/file_specification The right-hand side specifies one or more files in the client workspace and has the form: //clientname/file_specification Go creates a p4 client to check out files into its sandbox with the 'clobber' option set. All other options use default values as defined by Perforce. Client name is generated automatically by Go. Hence, you can use anything as 'clientname' on the right-hand side in view mapping. The client name format is: cruise-[hostname]-[config repo id]-[a random hash code], for example \"cruise-myhostname-configrepo1-wOaJ9kjpfgOLQCncki19ikXt5Q\". Go views are in the same format as that used by Perforce itself. In fact you should be able to copy a Perforce view from your existing Perforce setup and paste it into the view section. For example:                  top <git> {#config-repo-git} The config repo `` material element specifies the location of your code base in a GIT repository. Go only supports remote repositories. Notes: git versions 1.9 and above are supported by Go. If 'branch' is defined, Go will check out the specified branch. Otherwise, Go will check out the master branch. If there are submodules in the repository, Go will check out them as well. While installing msysGit On Windows machines for Go server, please choose Option iii, namely Run Git and included UNIX tools from windows command prompt If you are using git through SSH on windows, please ensure that the HOME user environment variable is set to the full path of the parent directory where the .ssh/ directory is located.

Material name can contain the following characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, fullstop, underscore and hyphen. Spaces are not allowed. Material name is case insensitive. The max length is 255 characters. autoUpdate No By default Go polls the repository for changes automatically. If autoUpdate is set to false then Go will not poll the repository for changes. For config repo materials, autoUpdate is always set to true. Examples are:      top <tfs> {#config-repo-tfs} The config repo `` material element specifies the location of your code base in a TFS Source repository. Attributes Attribute Required Description url Yes url for the Collection on the TFS Server. Domain No Domain name for TFS authentication credentials.

The max length is 255 characters. autoUpdate No By default Go polls the repository for changes automatically. If autoUpdate is set to false then Go will not poll the repository for changes. For config repo materials, autoUpdate is always set to true. Examples are:      top <scm> {#config-repo-scm} The config repo `` material element specifies the location of your code base in any of the  SCM repositories. Attributes Attribute Required Description ref Yes The unique package repository id. Examples are:      top <repositories> {#repositories} The `` element is a container of package repositories. Example   ...                                            property-name             property-value                  ...                                                                property-name                 property-value                          ...                                    top <repository> {#repository} The `` element specifies a single repository. Repository must be be unique by id and name  name is case-insensitive  across repositories configuration.

Package name can contain the following characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, fullstop, underscore and hyphen. Spaces are not allowed. Name is case-insensitive in Go and the length should be less than 255 characters. autoUpdate No By default Go polls the repository for changes automatically. If autoUpdate is set to false then Go will not poll the repository for changes. Instead it will check for changes only when you trigger a pipeline that contains this material. top <artifactStores> {#artifactStores} The element is a container of many. Example   ...                              RegistryURL           https://index.docker.io/v1/                             Username           boohoo                             Password           password                      top <artifactStore> {#artifactStore} The element specifies a global artifact store to publish/fetch external artifacts. It can contain zero or more elements to specify the plugin properties. Attributes Attribute Required Description pluginId Yes The ID of artifact plugin.

This will be used later in the publish config top <secretConfigs> {#secretConfigs} The `` element is a container of secret configurations. There can be zero or more secret configurations. Examples        ...    top <secretConfig> {#secretConfig} The `` element specifies a single secret configuration. It must be unique  including case  across the entire configuration. A secretConfig should have a unique id attribute and should be associated to plugin through the pluginId attribute. Attributes Attribute Required Description id Yes The id is used to identify a secret config, and must be unique. The id can contain the following characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, period  . , underscore  _  and hyphen  - . Spaces are not allowed. The length should be less than 255 characters. pluginId Yes The id of secrets plugin. Example:               SecretsFilePath       /users/go/secret.db         top <description> {#description} The `` element specifies description for the element. Example: This is a sample description. top <rules> {#rules} The `` element is a container for allow and deny rule. More about rules can be read from here. Example:   *   * top <allow> {#allow} The `` element is the rule which allows the usage of the defined secret based on action, configured type and resource. Attributes Attribute Required Description action Yes Action for the entity specified under attribute type. type Yes Any GoCD entity type for which rule will be applied. Example: * top <deny> {#deny} The `` element is the rule which denies the usage of the defined secret based on action, configured type and resource. Attributes Attribute Required Description action Yes Action for the entity specified under attribute type. type Yes Any GoCD entity type for which rule will be applied. Example: * top <pipelines> {#pipelines} The `` element is a container of pipelines. Attributes Attribute Required Description group No The name is used to identify a pipeline group, and must be unique. The name can contain the following characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, period  . , underscore  _  and hyphen  - . Spaces are not allowed. The length should be less than 255 characters. The default name is 'defaultGroup'. Examples   ...                                                                      linux                                                                  top <authorization> {#authorization} The `` tag allows you to specify the what users and roles are able to administer, view or operate any particular group of pipelines. top <admins> {#admins} The `` element is a permission section to specify who can administer the pipeline group. Go administrators can define roles and users in the tag. Users and Roles defined as group admins can view and operate on all pipelines in this pipeline group. They are allowed to navigate to the admin page where they can only see and edit this pipeline group which includes creating and modifying pipelines in this group,via the Pipeline Configuration Tab. They have no permission to view or modify the Pipeline Templates even if they are used by any pipeline in this group. Note: Go Administrators  admins  defined in security tab, can administer all pipeline groups. Examples Given the following configuration only admins, lqiao and any users having the role 'studios_group_admin'.   ...                             lqiao            studios_group_admin                        ......         top <view> {#view} The `` element is a permission section to specify who can see the pipelines under the pipeline group. You can define roles and users in the tag. **Note:**Administrators  admins  can see all pipeline groups. Any other users or roles that are not listed under the `` tag will be unable to see this pipeline group Examples Given the following configuration only administrators can operate the pipeline group, and only admins, lqiao and any users having the role 'go_readonly_member' can see the pipeline.   ...                             lqiao            go_readonly_member                        ......         top <operate> {#operate} The `` element specifies who can operate the pipelines under the pipeline group. You can define roles and users. **Note:**Any users/roles that are not listed under the [] #view  tag will be unable to see this pipeline group  even if they are listed as being allowed to that pipeline group Examples Given the following configuration, only admins, lqiao, jez and the users having the role 'go_core_member' can operate the pipeline group. Only admins, lqiao and the users having the role 'go_readonly_member' can see the pipeline  jez and go_core_member cannot .   ...                             lqiao            go_readonly_member                              lqiao            jez            go_core_member                        ......         top <pipeline> {#pipeline} The `` element specifies a single pipeline. It must be unique  including case  across the entire configuration  not only in the pipeline group . Notes: There should be at least one stage in one pipeline. Go uses the pipeline name to identify the pipeline. If you change the pipeline name, you will lose the history of the pipeline. Attributes Attribute Required Description name Yes The name is used to identify a pipeline, so each pipeline name must be unique. Pipeline name can contain the following characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, fullstop, underscore and hyphen. Spaces are not allowed. Name is case-insensitive in Go and the length should be less than 255 characters. labeltemplate No Both of material names and ${COUNT} are available in the labeltemplate and the default value of labeltemplate is '${COUNT}'. If you just specify labeltemplate=\"foo-1.0-${COUNT}\", your pipeline will show foo-1.0-1, foo-1.0-2, and so on. When you reference material names in the labeltemplate, Go will use the revisions of the reference materials to populate the pipeline label. For example, given a mateial name is 'svnrepo' in a pipeline, when you specify labeltemplate=\"foo-1.0-${svnrepo}\", then your pipeline would show foo-1.0-3123, foo-1.0-3124, and so on. Material names are case insensitive. The max length of a pipeline label is 255. If a material name is 'svnrepo', the following labeltemplates are valid: ${COUNT}, ${svnrepo}, foo-${COUNT}-${SVNrepo}, foo-${svnrepo}-${COUNT}-bar. lockBehavior No The possible values are \"none\", \"lockOnFailure\" or \"unlockWhenFinished\".The default value is \"none\". When set to \"lockOnFailure\", GoCD ensures that only a single instance of a pipeline can be run at a time and the pipeline will be locked if it fails, unless it is the last stage which fails. When set to \"unlockWhenFinished\", GoCD ensures that only a single instance of a pipeline can be run at a time, and the pipeline will be unlocked as soon as it finishes  success or failure , or reaches a manual stage. template No The name of the template that this pipeline references. If this is set, no stages may be defined in this pipeline. Examples            bar                                                      linux                                                   top <params> {#params} The element specifies the list of parameters  Element [param] #param  elements to be used in a pipeline or a pipeline template. You can specify these under a [] #pipeline  and can be used anywhere inside pipeline/stage/job definition. top <param> {#param} A `` defines the parameter name that will be substituted with the paramerter value that will be substituted in a pipeline or a pipeline template. Example:     echo     /repo/branch top <trackingtool> {#trackingtool} The `` element can be used to specify links to an issue tracker. Go will construct a link based on the commit message that you can use to take you to your tracking tool  JIRA issue, Trac issue etc . Attributes Attribute Required Description link Yes a URL with a string '${ID}'. Go will replace the string '${ID}' with the first matched group value at run-time. regex Yes A regex to identify the IDs. Go will find the first matched group in your commit messages and use it to construct the hyper-link. Examples Suppose you are using a Web Application to manage your tasks or bugs, and the link looks like http://your-trackingtool/yourproject/512, '512' is your task ID. Your configuration would be:      ... If you check in some code with a commit message which includes the characters 'evo-512' then that will appear in the modification pop-up box as a link. When you click it, Go will take you to the web page http://your-trackingtool/yourproject/512. For example: If you use Jira for your task manager, the configuration would be:      ... Notes: You can not define multiple tracking tools in one pipeline. top <timer> {#timer} The `` element specifies a cron-like schedule to build the pipeline. Attributes Attribute Required Description onlyOnChanges No Skips scheduling if the previous run of the pipeline was with the latest material s . This option is typically useful when automatic pipeline scheduling is turned off. Examples For example to run a pipeline once a night at 10pm on weekdays:   0 0 22 ? * MON-FRI   ... Go uses the Quartz scheduler internally. For convenience we reproduce the Quartz cron documentation here: Format A cron expression is a string comprised of 6 or 7 fields separated by white space. Fields can contain any of the allowed values, along with various combinations of the allowed special characters for that field. The fields are as follows: Field Name Mandatory? Allowed Values Allowed Special Characters Seconds YES 0-59 , - * / Minutes YES 0-59 , - * / Hours YES 0-23 , - * / Day of month YES 1-31 , - * ? / L W\\ Month YES 1-12 or JAN-DEC , - * / Day of week YES 1-7 or SUN-SAT , - * ? / L # Year NO empty, 1970-2099 , - * / So cron expressions can be as simple as this: * * * * * ? or more complex, like this: 0 15 10 ? * 6L 2002-2005 Special characters *  \"all values\"  - used to select all values within a field. For example, \"*\" in the minute field means \"every minute\". ?  \"no specific value\"  - useful when you need to specify something in one of the two fields in which the character is allowed, but not the other. For example, if I want my trigger to fire on a particular day of the month  say, the 10th , but don't care what day of the week that happens to be, I would put \"10\" in the day-of-month field, and \"?\" in the day-of-week field. See the examples below for clarification. - - used to specify ranges. For example, \"10-12\" in the hour field means \"the hours 10, 11 and 12\". , - used to specify additional values. For example, \"MON,WED,FRI\" in the day-of-week field means \"the days Monday, Wednesday, and Friday\". / - used to specify increments. For example, \"0/15\" in the seconds field means \"the seconds 0, 15, 30, and 45\". And \"5/15\" in the seconds field means \"the seconds 5, 20, 35, and 50\". You can also specify '/' after the '' character - in this case '' is equivalent to having '0' before the '/'. '1/3' in the day-of-month field means \"fire every 3 days starting on the first day of the month\". L  \"last\"  - has different meaning in each of the two fields in which it is allowed. For example, the value \"L\" in the day-of-month field means \"the last day of the month\" - day 31 for January, day 28 for February on non-leap years. If used in the day-of-week field by itself, it simply means \"7\" or \"SAT\". But if used in the day-of-week field after another value, it means \"the last xxx day of the month\" - for example \"6L\" means \"the last friday of the month\". When using the 'L' option, it is important not to specify lists, or ranges of values, as you'll get confusing results. W  \"weekday\"  - used to specify the weekday  Monday-Friday  nearest the given day. As an example, if you were to specify \"15W\" as the value for the day-of-month field, the meaning is: \"the nearest weekday to the 15th of the month\". So if the 15th is a Saturday, the trigger will fire on Friday the 14th. If the 15th is a Sunday, the trigger will fire on Monday the 16th. If the 15th is a Tuesday, then it will fire on Tuesday the 15th. However if you specify \"1W\" as the value for day-of-month, and the 1st is a Saturday, the trigger will fire on Monday the 3rd, as it will not 'jump' over the boundary of a month's days. The 'W' character can only be specified when the day-of-month is a single day, not a range or list of days. The 'L' and 'W' characters can also be combined in the day-of-month field to yield 'LW', which translates to \"last weekday of the month\". # - used to specify \"the nth\" XXX day of the month. For example, the value of \"6#3\" in the day-of-week field means \"the third Friday of the month\"  day 6 = Friday and \"#3\" = the 3rd one in the month . Other examples: \"2#1\" = the first Monday of the month and \"4#5\" = the fifth Wednesday of the month. Note that if you specify \"#5\" and there is not 5 of the given day-of-week in the month, then no firing will occur that month. The legal characters and the names of months and days of the week are not case sensitive. MON is the same as mon. Examples Here are some full examples: Expression Meaning 0 0 12 * * ? Fire at 12pm  noon  every day 0 15 10 ? * * Fire at 10:15am every day 0 15 10 * * ? Fire at 10:15am every day 0 15 10 * * ? * Fire at 10:15am every day 0 15 10 * * ? 2005 Fire at 10:15am every day during the year 2005 0 * 14 * * ?

Fire at 10:15am on the last day of every month 0 15 10 ? * 6L Fire at 10:15am on the last Friday of every month 0 15 10 ? * 6L Fire at 10:15am on the last Friday of every month 0 15 10 ? * 6L 2002-2005 Fire at 10:15am on every last friday of every month during the years 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005 0 15 10 ? * 6#3 Fire at 10:15am on the third Friday of every month 0 0 12 1/5 * ? Fire at 12pm  noon  every 5 days every month, starting on the first day of the month. 0 11 11 11 11 ? Fire every November 11th at 11:11am. Pay attention to the effects of '?' and '*' in the day-of-week and day-of-month fields! Notes Support for specifying both a day-of-week and a day-of-month value is not complete  you must currently use the '?' character in one of these fields . Be careful when setting fire times between mid-night and 1:00 AM - \"daylight savings\" can cause a skip or a repeat depending on whether the time moves back or jumps forward. top <materials> {#materials} The `` element specifies the source of the pipeline changes. Generally this will be your codebase in your source control repository. Notes: Go supports multiple materials with the restriction that every material must contain a unique \"dest\" folder  that is not a subfolder of any other material . Go will check out the source code into this folder for each material. Examples              ... Multiple materials:                                         ... top <filter> {#filter} The `` element specifies files in changesets that should not trigger a pipeline automatically. When a pipeline is triggered by files that are not ignored the filtered files will still be updated with other files. You can only define one filter under each SCM material. When you trigger a pipeline manually, it will update to most recent revision, including filtered files. Examples            top <ignore> {#ignore} The `` element is used to specify a set of files that are ignored when Go checks for changes. Repository changesets which only contain these files will not trigger a pipeline automatically. Attributes Attribute Required Description pattern Yes defines a pattern  Ant-style  for the files to be ignored. Changes of thoes files will not trigger the pipeline. the pattern is relative to the root of the SCM repository, not the sandbox of the pipeline. Notes can occur multiple times under [] #filter . The pattern is relative to the root directory of the SCM repository, not the sandbox in the agent side or the materials URL. Ignored files are still updated when other files are updated. Examples: Ignore everything under the folder 'doc'. Ignore files under the folder 'doc', excluding any subfolder. Ignore files that are under the directory 'framework/helper' and the file extension is .doc. Ignore files that are under the root directory of SCM repository and the file extension is .pdf. Ignore all the files that is under any 'helper' folder and the file extension is .pdf. Ignore all the files that are in the nested directory under folder 'helper' of the repository and the file extension is .pdf. top <svn> {#svn} The `` element specifies the location of your code base in Subversion repository. Attributes Attribute Required Description url Yes URL for the remote repository. Go supports the following protocols for subversion: http, https, svn and svn+ssh, but does not support 'file:///'. username No The user account for the remote repository. password No The password for the specified user checkexternals No The default value is false, the value should be either one of true/false or 1/0. 'true' or '1' means that the changes of externals will trigger the pipeline automatically. dest Required if there are multiple materials The directory where the code will be checked out. This is relative to the sandbox of the Go Agent. Go prevents the destination folder from being outside the agent's sandbox. materialName Required if this material is referenced in pipeline labeltemplate The name to identify a material. Material name can contain the following characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, fullstop, underscore and hyphen, but whitespace is not allowed. A material name is case insensitive and starting with fullstop is invalid. It needs to be unique within a pipeline. The max length is 255 characters. autoUpdate No By default Go polls the repository for changes automatically. If autoUpdate is set to false then Go will not poll the repository for changes. Instead it will check for changes only when you trigger a pipeline that contains this material or it receives a notification through a post-commit hook. If the same material is specified more than once in the configuration file, all of them must have the same value for autoUpdate. invertFilter No Inverts any filter elements, turning them into whitelists. Only files that match the filter will trigger a new build. Notes: Go cannot automatically accept svn SSL certificates. If you are using https for svn repository, you have to go to the Server and each Agent, and as the user 'go' do a command \"svn update\" to store the certificates in the cache permanently. Examples: For a Go Agent on linux with the following configuration:                   ... Go Agent will check out source code from http://svn-server.com/framework to /var/lib/go-agent/pipelines/myproduct/framwork, and from http://svn-server.com/componentOne to /var/lib/go-agent/pipelines/myproduct/mycomponent. top <hg> {#hg} The `` element specifies the location of your code base in a Mercurial repository. Go supports the http and ssh for Mercurial. Notes: You must install Mercurial 1.5 or above on the Go Server and Go Agents for the jobs need Mercurial. Go does not ship with Mercurial. Attributes Attribute Required Description url Yes URL to fetch source code from the Mercurial repository. If you specify the username and password for the Mercurial repository, you should put them into the url. Mercurial supports an optional identifier after # in the url, which indicates a particular branch, tag or changeset. This option can be used to configure mercurial branches in Go. dest Only for multiple materials The directory where the code will be checked out. This is relative to the sandbox of the Go Agent. Go prevents the destination folder from being outside the agent's sandbox. materialName Required if this material is referenced in pipeline labeltemplate The name to identify a material. Material name can contain the following characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, fullstop, underscore and hyphen. Spaces are not allowed. Material name is case insensitive. It needs to be unique within a pipeline. The max length is 255 characters. autoUpdate No By default Go polls the repository for changes automatically. If autoUpdate is set to false then Go will not poll the repository for changes. Instead it will check for changes only when you trigger a pipeline that contains this material. If the same material is specified more than once in the configuration file, all of them must have the same value for autoUpdate. invertFilter No Inverts any filter elements, turning them into whitelists. Only files that match the filter will trigger a new build. Examples              ... #Specifying a mercurial branch.              ... Note that # needs to be escaped with another # - hence the ## in the url above. top <p4> {#p4} The `` element specifies the location of your code base in a Perforce repository. Notes: Go will use directory under pipelines/{pipelineName} in agent side as Perforce root directory of perforce client workspace. Attributes Attribute Required Description port Yes Perforce server connection to use  host:port . This is the same as you would pass in the p4port parameter for the p4 command line or in the P4PORT environment variable. username No Perforce username to use. password No Password for the specified user. useTickets No Set to true to work with perforce tickets. Go will do a p4 login using the supplied password before each command. We recommend that you make your user a part of a p4 group, and set the ticket timeout to unlimited as described here. dest Only for multiple materials The directory where the code will be checked out. This is relative to the sandbox of the Go Agent. Go prevents the destination folder from being outside the agent's sandbox. view Yes Valid Perforce view. The view should be a sub-element of P4. Click here to see details about VIEW of Perforce. materialName Required if this material is referenced in pipeline labeltemplate The name to identify a material. Material name can contain the following characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, fullstop, underscore and hyphen. Spaces are not allowed. Material name is case insensitive. It needs to be unique within a pipeline. The max length is 255 characters. autoUpdate No By default Go polls the repository for changes automatically. If autoUpdate is set to false then Go will not poll the repository for changes. Instead it will check for changes only when you trigger a pipeline that contains this material. If the same material is specified more than once in the configuration file, all of them must have the same value for autoUpdate. invertFilter No Inverts any filter elements, turning them into whitelists. Only files that match the filter will trigger a new build. Notes: You do not need to specify the above attributes if you have already defined them as system variables. So if you have a P4PASSWD variable defined then you can leave out the \"password\" tag defined above. If you already have them defined as system variables and also in Go configuration, Go will overwrite them before running p4. Views consist of multiple mappings. Each mapping has two parts: The left-hand side specifies one or more files in the depot and has the form: //depotname/file_specification The right-hand side specifies one or more files in the client workspace and has the form: //clientname/file_specification Go creates a p4 client to check out files into its sandbox with the 'clobber' option set. This means, during material update all writable-but-unopened files in the workspace would be overwritten on the agent. All other options use default values as defined by Perforce. Client name is generated automatically by Go. Hence, you can use anything as 'clientname' on the right-hand side in view mapping. The client name format is: cruise-[hostname]-[pipeline name]-[a random hash code], for example \"cruise-myhostname-mypipelinename-wOaJ9kjpfgOLQCncki19ikXt5Q\". THE GO_P4_CLIENT environment variable will have the client name used. This variable can be used in scripts to get the client name Go views are in the same format as that used by Perforce itself. In fact you should be able to copy a Perforce view from your existing Perforce setup and paste it into the view section. For example:                          ... top <git> {#git} The `` element specifies the location of your code base in a GIT repository. Go only supports remote repositories. Notes: git versions 1.7 and above are supported by Go. If 'branch' is defined, Go will check out the specified branch. Otherwise, Go will check out the master branch. If there are submodules in the repository, Go will check out them as well. msysGit on Windows has a defect which causes an error when using Go. Please ensure to use a build which fixes this. While installing msysGit On Windows machines for Go server or agents, please choose Option iii, namely Run Git and included UNIX tools from windows command prompt If you are using git through SSH on windows, please ensure that the HOME user environment variable is set to the full path of the parent directory where the .ssh/ directory is located. Attributes Attribute Required Description url Yes GIT URL for the repository. branch No a branch name in the repository. shallowClone No Add a --depth=N option to git cloning command on Go agent. Shallow clone truncates history to latest revisions, thus helps accelerating clone operation for repositories with long history. Cloning depth is dynamically calculated to ensure revisions from GO_FROM_REVISION to GO_TO_REVISION are included in the cloned repository. dest Only for multiple materials The directory under the sandbox of Go Agent. Go will check out the source code into this directory. materialName Required if this material is referenced in pipeline labeltemplate The name to identify a material. Material name can contain the following characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, fullstop, underscore and hyphen. Spaces are not allowed. Material name is case insensitive. It needs to be unique within a pipeline. The max length is 255 characters. autoUpdate No By default Go polls the repository for changes automatically. If autoUpdate is set to false then Go will not poll the repository for changes. Instead it will check for changes only when you trigger a pipeline that contains this material. If the same material is specified more than once in the configuration file, all of them must have the same value for autoUpdate. invertFilter No Inverts any filter elements, turning them into whitelists. Only files that match the filter will trigger a new build. Examples are:              ...              ... top <tfs> {#tfs} The `` element specifies the location of your code base in a TFS Source repository. Attributes Attribute Required Description URL Yes URL for the Collection on the TFS Server. Domain No Domain name for TFS authentication credentials. Username Yes Username of the account to access the TFS collection. Password Yes Password of the account to access the TFS collection. Project Path Yes The project path within the TFS collection. dest Only for multiple materials The directory where the code will be checked out. This is relative to the sandbox of the Go Agent. Go prevents the destination folder from being outside the agent's sandbox. invertFilter No Inverts any filter elements, turning them into whitelists. Only files that match the filter will trigger a new build. Examples are:              ...              ... top <package> {#package} The `` element refers to package which is defined as part of repositories configuration. Attributes Attribute Required Description ref Yes The ref tag holds the id of the package Example   ...                                            property-name             property-value                  ...                                                                property-name                 property-value                          ...                                           ...                                             ...          ...     top <pipeline> {#pipeline} The `` element specifies that successful completion of a stage in another pipeline will trigger the current pipeline to start. If there are multiple pipeline dependencies, then any one of them passing will trigger a new pipeline. Note that you can not specify two  or more  dependencies for the same upstream pipeline. Attributes Attribute Required Description pipelineName Yes The name of a pipeline that this pipeline depends on. stageName Yes The name of a stage which will trigger this pipeline once it is successful. materialName By default the materialName is the name of the upstream pipeline  the pipelineName . This is required if this material is referenced in pipeline labeltemplate The name to identify a material. Material name can contain the following characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, fullstop, underscore and hyphen. Spaces are not allowed. Material name is case insensitive. It needs to be unique within a pipeline. The max length is 255 characters. ignoreForScheduling No  false by default When set to true, the pipeline will not be automatically scheduled for changes to this material. However, when the pipeline is triggered  either by another material, or a manual or timer trigger , it will always pick up the latest available version of this material Notes: The downstream pipeline wouldn't be triggered if there was no passed stage in the upstream pipeline. Examples Suppose there are four pipelines, and they are commonLib1, commonLib2, Server and Client. For example, the stage 'distStage' in commonLib1 pipeline can trigger the other two pipelines, and the stage 'pkgstage' in commonLib2 pipeline can trigger Server pipeline. The configuration would be:                   ...              ... If the Server pipeline needs to be triggered only when commonLib2 changes, the ignoreForScheduling flag can be set for the commonLib1 material:                   ... top <stage> {#stage} The element specifies a set of jobs. If any job in a given stage fails then the stage will fail. If a stage has an [] #approval  configuration with manual type it can only be triggered manually  i.e. a user must click on the trigger button on the UI . If the previous stage has failed, you can still trigger the following stage manually. Notes: There must be at least one job in stage. Attributes Attribute Required Description name Yes The name is used to identify a stage in the pipeline, so it has to be unique  case insensitive  for that ``. The available characters in stage name are following: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, fullstop, underscore and hyphen. Spaces are not allowed. fetchMaterials No  Default: true Perform material updates or checkouts on the agent. Set this attribute to false to skip this operation. cleanWorkingDir No  Default: false Remove all files/directories in the working directory on the agent. By default this operation is skipped. artifactCleanupProhibited No  Default: false Never cleanup artifacts for this stage, if purging artifacts is configured at the Server Level. Examples   ...            bar                            linux                                      top <jobs> {#jobs} The `` element specify the set of jobs for a stage. Note: can contain several [] #job  elements. These jobs can run in parallel on different agents. Examples                        linux                                       top <job> {#job} A job is the basic unit of work. It is executed on an agent. A job can fetch artifacts from Go Server, execute tasks and publish artifacts back to Go Server. A job can also be associated with a set of `` or an elastic profile through the elasticProfileId attribute. Resources are used to match a Job to an Agent. ElasticProfileId is used to match a job to an Elastic Agent. An Agent can run a Job if it has all the resources or elasticProfileId that the Job specifies. A job cannot have both resources as well as elasticProfileId. If a Job has no resources then it can be built by any Agent  But not by an elastic agent Attributes Attribute Required Description name Yes The name of the job. The name must be unique  ignoring case  within a ``. The name can contain: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, fullstop, underscore and hyphen only. Spaces are not allowed. runOnAllAgents No If set to 'true' then the Job will run on all agents that can run the job. runInstanceCount No If set to 'x'  integer  then 'x' instances of Job will be spawned during scheduling. Environment variables GO_JOB_RUN_INDEX  with values 1-x for every Job  and GO_JOB_RUN_COUNT  with value x for each Job  will be exposed to each task of Job. timeout No A job can be configured to time out if it does not generate any console output for a period of time. Use this attribute to define the timeout value in minutes. Define timeout as 0 if the job should never time out. If the attribute is not defined, the default `` level timeout behaviour will apply. elasticProfileId No A job can be configured to run on an elastic agent by specifying this attribute, which maps to the id of an existing ``. MUST NOT be specified along with resources. Examples               bar                linux                                 linux               top <resources> {#resources} `` specifies the resources needed for a job. A job can have zero or more resources. If a job has no resources it can be built on any agent. Example:        jdk5     tomcat5     mercurial    top <resource> {#resource} A `` is a text tag that specifies a resource which a job requires to build. An Agent must have all the Resources specified for a Job to be able to run that Job. Validations: Resources are case-insensitive. A resource name can contain alphanumeric characters, hyphens  - , spaces, periods  .  and pipes  | . Example:   jdk5   tomcat5   mercurial top <tasks> {#tasks} specifies the tasks  like [] #ant , `` etc  that will run as part of a job. There can be zero or more tasks. These tasks are executed in the order specified in the configuration file. If a task fails, the subsequent tasks are not run unless they have `` defined. The following environment variables are set for all tasks: Attribute Description GO_SERVER_URL The base URL for the server, including '/go'. For example: https://localhost:8154/go GO_PIPELINE_NAME The name of the pipeline to which the job belongs to GO_PIPELINE_LABEL The label of the pipeline to which the job belongs to GO_STAGE_NAME The name of the stage to which the job belongs to GO_STAGE_COUNTER The re-run counter of the stage to which the job belongs to GO_JOB_NAME The name of the job that is being run GO_DEPENDENCY_LABEL_ _ The label of the upstream pipeline which triggered the pipeline which the job belongs to. For example: 'GO_DEPENDENCY_LABEL_FRAMEWORK_DEV' is the environment variable where the name of the upstream pipeline is 'framework' and the upstream stage is 'dev'. Hyphen  '-'  is an illegal character in an environment variable. So if a pipeline name or stage name contains '-', it will be converted into an underscore. For example, 'pipeline-foo' with stage 'stage-foo' becomes: GO_DEPENDENCY_LABEL_PIPELINE_FOO_STAGE_FOO. GO_TO_REVISION_ The lastest revision in modifications that the build running against for each configured SCM material. GO_FROM_REVISION_ The earlist revision in modifications that the build running against for each configured SCM material. Examples            top <ant> {#ant} Specifies an Ant build to run. Ant is assumed to be present from the command line on the agent. Go depends on and uses JDK 1.6. If JDK 1.4 or 1.5 binaries are required by a build, it can be specified in the Ant javac task. All paths specified are relative to the pipeline working directory. Attributes Attribute Required Description buildfile No Path to Ant build file. If not specified, the path defaults to 'build.xml'. target No Ant target s  to run. If not specified, the target defaults to 'default' workingdir No The directory from where Ant is invoked Examples Invoke Ant, specifying a set of targets to run:    Invoke Ant in a specific working directory with a set of targets:    top <exec> {#exec} Runs a specified command. The build fails if the command cannot be run or if it returns an error. All paths specified are relative to the pipeline working directory. Attributes Attribute Required Description command Yes The command or script to be executed, relative to the working directory args No Set of arguments  as a single string  to be passed to the command or script. Note that for complex or quoted arguments we suggest that you use separate `` tags for each argument. workingdir No The directory in which the script or command is to be executed. Note that this directory is relative to the directory where the agent checks out the materials. Examples Invoke ruby, specifying the working directory as tools/my-ruby-tool and executing the ruby script backup.rb.    top <arg> {#arg} Specify a single argument for exec command. This element is optional and can occur multiple times. It serves as an alternative to the \"args\" attribute of exec, but it allows the use of any character required for making argument. For example, you can specify double quote using the xml escaped format: \" **Note:**When running commands on Windows, Go won't launch your command with system shell  cmd.exe , so you can't use shell commands  like echo  directly. If you want, you can pass your shell command as arguments to the cmd.exe. On Windows you should specify the full name of your script file such as \"mybuild.bat\".  Only specifying \"mybuild\" won't work Examples Echo something on Windows:   /c   echo   something to print out Run command with pipe character in arguments:   D:\\projects\\project\\project-8.sln   /REBUILD   /CFG=\"Release_99|Win32\" top <nant> {#nant} Specifies a NAnt build to run. NAnt is assumed to be present from the command line on the agent. All paths specified must be relative to the pipeline working directory. Attributes Attribute Required Description buildfile No Path to NAnt build file. If not specified, the path defaults to 'default.build'. The path is relative to the sandbox directory and cannot be outside the sandbox. target No NAnt target s  to run. If not specified, defaults to the default target of the build file. workingdir No The directory from where NAnt is invoked nantpath No Path of the directory in which NAnt is installed. By default Go will assume that NAnt is in the system environment variable ${PATH}. If the path is specified, then the path must be the same in all agents which run the job. Examples Invoke NAnt, specifying a set of targets to run:    top <rake> {#rake} Specifies a Rake build to be run. Ruby and Rake are assumed to be present from the command line on the agent. All paths specified must be relative to the pipeline working directory. Attributes Attribute Required Description buildfile No Path to Rake file. If not specified, the path defaults to 'rakefile'. The path cannot start from '.' target No Rake target s  to run. If not specified, defaults to the default target of the build file workingdir No The directory from where Rake is invoked Examples Invoke rake, specifying a set of targets to run:    top <fetchartifact> {#fetchartifact} Fetch artifacts from: 1. previous stages in the same pipeline, or 2. stages of pipelines that this pipeline depends on, directly or indirectly  ancestor pipelines . When pointed to parent/ancestor pipeline, fetch task can pull artifacts from the upstream-stage or stages before it. This restriction has been introduced in 12.2. Stages after the upstream stage can not be fetched from, because they may not be complete when the fetch call executes. All file paths specified are relative to the pipeline working directory. Attributes Attribute Required Description artifactOrigin Yes Indicates where the artifact needs to be pulled from. Supported values are gocd and external. gocd implies that the artifact needs to be fetched from the gocd server, external implies that the artifact must be fetched from an external artifact store. pipeline No This value can either be: 1. the name of upstream pipeline on which the pipeline of the job depends on. The pipeline should be added as a dependency under ``, or 2. the hierarchy of an ancestor pipeline of the current pipeline. Example, The value \"BuildPipeline/AcceptancePipeline\" denotes that the fetch task attempts to fetch artifacts from its ancestor 'BuildPipeline'. The given hierarchy denotes that the current pipeline depends on 'AcceptancePipeline' which in turn depends on 'BuildPipeline' using the dependency material definition given under materials. Defaults to current pipeline if not specified. stage Yes The name of the stage to fetch artifacts from job Yes The name of the job to fetch artifacts from srcdir One of srcdir/srcfile if artifact origin is gocd The path of the artifact directory of a specific job, relative to the sandbox directory. If the directory does not exist, the job is failed. Should be specified if artifactOrigin is gocd. srcfile One of srcdir/srcfile if artifact origin is gocd The path of the artifact file of a specific job. Should be specified if artifactOrigin is gocd. dest No The path of the directory where the artifact is fetched to. The directory is overwritten if it already exists. The directory path is relative to the pipeline working directory. Should be specified if artifactOrigin is gocd. artifactId Yes, if artifact origin is external The id of the external artifact that is published by the plugin in the upstream job. Should be specified if the artifact origin is external. configuration No 'A list of key-value pairs which defines the plugin configuration. Should be specified if artifact origin is external. Note: If the file does not exist, the job will fail. Go will not fetch the artifact again if it has not changed. The directory path is relative to the pipeline working directory. | Example: Fetch all artifacts in the directory 'pkg' from the previous stage in the same pipeline and put them under the directory 'lib'        ...                                                                                 Filename               target/deployable.jar                                                                                                                                          dest_on_agent               release_candidate.jar                                                             Fetch a single artifact from a stage in the upstream pipeline 'framework' and put it under the directory 'lib'                                                           Fetch a single artifact from a stage in an ancestor pipeline 'Build' and put it under the directory 'pkg'                                                           top <runif> {#runif} Specifies when a task should be allowed to run. Multiple conditions may be defined for each task. A running job on an agent has two possible states: passed or failed. A job starts in the state \"passed\". If any task fails, it transitions to the state \"failed\"\"\". A task can specify any of three possible runif filters: 'passed', 'failed' or 'any'.  'passed' is the default Attributes Attribute Required Description status Yes The status is the job's current status. The value should be one of 'passed', 'failed' or 'any'. Notes: ] #runif  can also be defined under [ task even if has somes e.g.                           Examples Given the tasks in a job is following:                                          #Scenario one: If task 1 passed, task 2 would be executed. If task 2 passed, task 3 would NOT be executed. If task 2 failed, task 3 would be executed. #Scenario two: If task 1 failed, task 2 would NOT be executed. Instead, task 3 `` would be executed. top <oncancel> {#oncancel} Specifies a task to execute when a stage is cancelled. Only one task can be defined in ``. If a job is cancelled during the assigning phase, the job will not start preparing If a job is cancelled during the preparing phase, preparing will complete, but no tasks will be executed If a job is cancelled during the building phase: If the currently running task does not have `` defined, the task will be killed If the currently running task does have defined, the task defined within will execute immediately. As soon as both the original task and the `` task are completed, no other tasks will execute If a job is cancelled during the completing phase, the agent will ignore the request and complete as planned Examples The task 'start_server' starts a process on an agent. When the stage is cancelled, the agent will invoke the cancel task 'kill_server' to kill the process early and clean up any extra files.                        top <artifacts> {#artifacts} `` specifies what files the agent will publish to the server or an external artifact store. Examples                                             Image           gocd/gocd-demo                             Tag           v${GO_PIPELINE_COUNTER}                         top <artifact> {#artifact} Publish build or test artifacts to the artifact repository for the job. The src attribute should point towards a folder that contains the test output files. Go will use these to generate a test report if the artifact type is test. Test information is placed in the Failures and Test sub-tabs. Test results from multiple jobs are aggregated on the stage detail pages. This allows you to see the results of tests from both functional and unit tests even if they are run in different jobs. Attributes Attribute Required Description type Yes Type can be either build or test. This identifies the type of artifact that is uploaded to the GoCD server src Yes, if type is build or test The file or folders to publish to the server. Go will only upload files that are in the working directory of the job. You can use wildcards to specify the files and folders to upload: ** means any path, * means any file or folder name. Should be specified if type is build or test dest No The destination is relative to the artifacts folder of the current instance on the server side. If it is not specified, the artifact will be stored in the root of the artifacts directory. Should be specified if type is build or test id Yes, if type is external The artifact id for an external artifact. This id can be used later in a downstream fetch task. Should be specified if type is external. storeId Yes, if type is external The artifact store id referencing an existing global artifact store. Should be specified if type is external. configuration No 'A list of key-value pairs which defines the plugin configuration. Should be specified if type is external. You can use wildcards to specify which files to upload to the go server in case of build or test artifacts. The wildcard syntax follows the commonly used ant/nant style. So \"target/**/*.xml\" would upload all xml files in the target directory and any of its subdirectories. The original directory structure is preserved on the server. Examples for build artifact                       The following will upload all xml files to the server's artifact repository.            top Examples for test artifact            Examples for external artifact                                   Image           gocd/gocd-demo                             Tag           v${GO_PIPELINE_COUNTER}                         top <tabs> {#tabs} The `` element allows you to add tabs to the Job Details page. You can put any artifact that can be rendered by a web browser into a tab. For example, if your coverage tool produces an html report, you can easily place that report into a tab. Tabs are implemented as iframes  see W3C iframe definition  . Example:                       top <tab> {#tab} Define a tab with specific name and artifact to show. Attributes Attribute Required Description name Yes The name of the tab. If should be unique in that job. path Yes The relative path of a file in the artifact repository of the job. Example: Given some coverage information in 'target/Jcoverage' folder on the agent side, We configure a tab to show the coverage information by specifying a tab with the index.html file.                       top <approval> {#approval} Specifies how a stage should be triggered. `` of type 'manual' or 'success' can be used to stop a pipeline execution at the start of a stage and can only be resumed when it is manually approved on the pipeline activity page, stage details page or through RESTful url. Attributes Attribute Required Description type Yes Either 'manual' or 'success'. 'manual' means the stage needs to be approved manually. 'success' means the stage will be automatically triggered when the previous stage passes. allowOnlyOnSuccess No Setting this attribute to 'true' will ensure that the stage can triggered only if the previous stage  if any  has succeeded. Notes: must be the first sub-element of [] #stage . If an approval is not specified then the behavior is same as 'success' i.e. the stage will be automatically triggered when the previous stage passes. If attribute allowOnlyOnSuccess is not specified, then the behaviour is same as false.

This is great for a trial. However, it is one of the first things you should change, as soon as you decide to use GoCD more widely. GoCD has two methods of authentication built into it: Password-file based authentication and LDAP/Active Directory authentication. You can also choose from a collection of community-maintained plugins for other methods of authentication, such as using Google or GitHub OAuth. You can even write your own plugins for authentication  as in username/password combination  or authorization  as in deciding which GoCD roles a user should be allowed into  by using the authorization plugin endpoint. \"Authorization configuration\" is the term used in GoCD for the configuration which allows a GoCD administrator to configure the kind of authentication and authorization used by it. GoCD can be setup to use multiple authorization configurations at the same time. Note: The order of the configurations matters. They will be tried from the first one to the last one and each authorization configuration will be given a chance to authenticate a user, when a user tries to log in. If the user is successfully allowed by one of the configurations, then the following configurations will not be used. Consider the example image below: In this example, the password file authentication method will be tried first. If that succeeds, the user will be allowed to log in. If not, the LDAP authentication method will be tried next. If that succeeds, the user will be allowed to log in. If not, the user will be disallowed from logging in. Built-in methods of authentication Password-file authentication Create an authorization configuration, by going to the \"Admin\" menu and then into \"Security\" and then \"Authorization Configuration\". Click on \"Add\" and provide any identifier  ID  for the configuration and then choose \"Password File Authentication Plugin for GoCD\". Provide the path to a password file on the GoCD server. Specify allow only known users to login field. Learn more The password file plugin's documentation has information about the values that can go into a password file. LDAP/AD authentication Create an authorization configuration, by going to the \"Admin\" menu and then into \"Security\" and then \"Authorization Configuration\". Click on \"Add\" and provide any identifier  ID  for the configuration and then choose \"LDAP Authentication Plugin for GoCD\". Provide the appropriate values for your LDAP server. You might need to talk to the LDAP/AD server administrator at your organization to get the right values. Specify allow only known users to login field. Learn more The LDAP authentication plugin's documentation has more information about the configuration. It you've installed any other plugins, they will also be available at the \"Authorization Configuration\" page, ready to be setup. Configurable properties You can use one or more of the below to tweak settings such as the session configuration: System property name Default value Description go.server.session.timeout.seconds 1209600  14 days Idle session timeout  in seconds . Do not set this to -1 else the session will never timeout. go.sessioncookie.maxage.seconds 1209600  14 days Expiry of a session cookie. Set to -1 to expire the cookie on browser close. Do not set to 0 as this will cause the cookie to expire immediately. go.sessioncookie.secure N Set this to Y to allow a session cookie to be set only if the request was made over HTTPS. Do not set this property if the users access GoCD via HTTP url go.security.reauthentication.interval 1800000  30 mins in milliseconds GoCD forces a perodic re-authentication of users, this is to ensure any changes like removing of users or roles in the external authorization server are reflected in GoCD. The re-authentication interval  specified in milliseconds  is controlled by this property. See the \"Other config options\" page for instructions around setting these system property values. Controlling User Access GoCD checks if an authenticated user is an existing user or a new user  logging in for the first time . For new users, there are two behaviors GoCD can operate under: Automatically register the new user in GoCD and continue with the login process. Deny access to the user if not already a registered GoCD user. New users will have to be explicitly added by an admin. To switch the mode in which the GoCD Server operates: Login to GoCD as an admin Navigate to the \"Authorization Configuration\" section Set the \"Allow only known users to login\" for desired authorization configuration."},{"title":"Authorizing Users","description":"GoCD authorization and administration","keywords":"GoCD configuration, authorization, administration, users, roles, role-based security, security, security configuration, user permissions, pipeline groups, pipeline permissions, GoCD administration","href":"/configuration/dev_authorization.html","content":"Authorization With no security switched on, there is of course no authorization either. Once you have configured security, the default is that any user can perform any operation. However, GoCD can limit certain operations to particular Users or Roles, and manage membership of those Roles. Administrators GoCD allows you to restrict the users who can perform certain functions. Administrators is a special role that allows its members to perform any action in GoCD. Specifying administrators is optional -- without it, all users are automatically made administrators. If administrators are specified, only they can perform the following actions: Access the \"administration\" tab Add/Edit Pipeline Templates Enable agents Add / remove agent resources Users can be made administrators from the \"User Summary\" tab in the \"Admin\" section. To give admin privileges to users and/or roles via \"Config xml\", please refer to the example in the section below, where members of the \"go_admin\" role  jhumble and qiao , along with the user chris, can administer Go. Role-based Access Control You can define roles that can be used anywhere that authorization is required. A role is just a group of users. Administrators can add users to a new or existing role from the \"User Summary\" tab in the \"Admin\" section. Here, you can select any number of users and assign a new or existing role to them. In this example, user \"aantony\" is being added to the role \"analyst\" For power users, here's how you would configure roles via \"Config XML\":                                                            dyang             pavan                                                     jhumble             qiao                                           go_admin         chris                In this example, the \"qa\" role has two users: dyang and pavan. The \"go_admin\" role also has two users: jhumble and qiao. Starting GoCD 19.11.0, the roles can be configured to allow how the users assigned the role can access a GoCD entity. GoCD system administrators can now define a role with a policy that will contain a set of permissions to govern access of a GoCD entity for the users belonging to the role. The following role definition would grant view action permissions for GoCD entity type environment with the matching wild card pattern: ...                                            env*                            ... This means that any user which has the role view-permissions will get view access to the environments which have the name starting with env. You can read more about policy here. Specifying permissions for pipeline groups GoCD allows you to group pipelines together. If you define pipeline groups, you can specify who is able to view or operate those groups. To do this, you configure permissions to the pipeline group. System administrators will continue to have full access to the pipeline group even if they have not been explicitly granted permissions. The \"view\" permission allows users to view the pipeline. It does not give permission to trigger pipelines, approve stages, or re-run stages. In the below example, the users \"akrishna\" and \"aantony\" can view the pipelines in this group, but they cannot perform any operations on it. The \"operate\" permission allows users to trigger pipelines and its stages. In the below example, the role \"developer\" is being granted the operate permission and will be able to trigger pipelines and its stages within this group. The \"admin\" permission makes the user a Pipeline Group Administrator allowing him to view, operate and administer the pipeline group. In the below example, role \"admins\" has been granted this permission. Note that is is possible to give a user or role only the operate permission. In the example below, the user \"bot\" only has operate permission. That means they can not view the pipeline, they can only operate it. This can be used to enable a script to operate on pipelines via the APIs without letting that user access any other features of Go. To edit the permissions for a pipeline group, navigate to the \"Pipelines\" tab on the \"Admin\" section: Then, click the \"Edit\" link for the pipeline group you want to manage permissions for: If no authorization is defined for a pipeline group, all GoCD users will have view and operate permissions to that group. For power users, here's how you would configure permissions via \"Config XML\":               aantony       akrishna       developer                 bot       developer                 admins           ... Adding authorization to approvals In GoCD, it is possible to specify manual approvals between stages. You can also specify which user is allowed to trigger manual approvals. The authorization can be inherited from the pipeline group this pipeline belongs to. But defining specific permissions overrides this. In the example below, only members of the role \"admin\", and the user \"goleys\", can trigger the approval. For power users, here's how you would configure authorization for approvals for a stage via \"Config XML\":               admin       goleys                                uat                                       Specifying permissions for templates A GoCD Administrator can make any user a template administrator for a specific template.

These agents can be in a data center or in the cloud or both, and may be physical or virtual. Developers can start building their own elastic-agent plugins by forking the skeleton plugin and looking at a sample docker plugin, docker swarm plugin as an example reference implementation. Why elastic agents? A feature like this can allow for more efficient use of agent machines, can allow flexible scaling and in many cases, can reduce the cost of running agents. Imagine an automated performance test which runs occasionally and needs a lot of machines. These machines can be started at the beginning of the performance test, possibly using some cloud service, and then brought down when not needed. This feature should enable a more flexible and dynamic build grid. Configuration of elastic agents Note: GoCD version 19.3.0 introduces the concept of cluster profile. The plugin settings are being removed from elastic agent extension in the favour of cluster profiles. If you are on an older version of GoCD, please refer this. Using GoCD elastic agents requires downloading and installing one of the available elastic agents plugin. Once the plugin is downloaded and installed, make sure to: Configure a cluster profile  Admin > Elastic Profiles . Configure an elastic agent profile  Admin > Elastic Profiles . Associate the elastic agent profile with one or more jobs. Concepts There are a few basic concepts to understand the elastic agent plugins in GoCD: Cluster Profile In most cases, a single GoCD instance is being utilized by multiple teams. Each team can have their own build environments e.g. development, staging, production. Earlier, with plugin settings, GoCD could only support one environment at a time. Now teams can leverage their own build environment by utilizing cluster profiles. Cluster profile usually contains the connection settings  endpoints, credentials  so that the GoCD server can connect to the elastic provider. An elastic provider depending on the plugin may be a docker server, AWS, azure, or a kubernetes cluster. Elastic Agent Profile An elastic agent profile usually contains the configuration for your agent. Depending on the plugin used, this may contain the machine image  ami, docker image , size of the CPU/memory/disk, network settings among other things. Once an elastic agent profile is defined, it should then be associated with a particular job. It's possible to define several profiles for different types jobs."},{"title":"Job Timeout","description":"GoCD job timeouts","keywords":"GoCD configuration, job timeouts, cancel jobs, console output, pipeline management, configure timeout","href":"/configuration/job_timeout.html","content":"Job Timeout Introduction GoCD can be configured to automatically cancel jobs that do not generate any console output for a period of time.

This page takes you through the lifecycle of expanding your cloud and maintaining your agents. Adding a GoCD agent to your cloud The first thing you need to do is install Go agent on the machine you want to add to the cloud. Once the GoCD agent has been installed and pointed at your GoCD server, go to the Agents tab on the GoCD dashboard. You should see something like this: Note that the hostname is as reported by the agent, and the IP address is as reported by the server. To add the agent to the cloud, click \"Enable\". Note that even after you have clicked \"Enable\", the agent will not be enabled until it next contacts the server -- so if your agent has stopped talking to the server, nothing will happen. Once your agent has successfully been enabled, it should no longer appear greyed out and will and be marked \"idle\". At this point your agent will automatically begin picking up jobs. Agents will automatically check out any code they need in order to start running jobs. Matching jobs to agents In its default state, GoCD server will assign scheduled jobs to the first available agent. GoCD doesn't have the ability to determine what operating system or other resources are present on a given agent. If you want particular jobs to run on particular agents, you'll need to specify resources . You can specify one or more resources that a particular job needs in order to execute. In the same way, you can specify that an agent has one or more resources. Go will then match jobs to agents, such that a job will only run on agents which have at least the resources required for that job. Resources are just plain text tags. There are no preset tags or conventions around tagging -- just use what makes sense to you. You might, for example, use operating systems as tags: \"RHEL linux\", \"Windows XP\". You could also use browsers, databases, or whatever else makes sense. We recommend you let your classification be driven by your jobs -- if you know that certain jobs will only work on certain machines, tag the jobs with the special resource or resources that job needs in order to work, and then classify the agents accordingly. Note: Resource matching is case-insensitive. To specify the resources that a job needs, go to the Pipelines configuration section of the Admin > Pipelines tab tab and edit the job that you want to specify resources for: Once you've specified the resources your jobs need, you'll want to describe the resources your agents have. You can do this very easily in the Agents tab. Just select the agents you want to describe, and click on the Resources button. Associate selected agent s  with a newly created resource Enter the name of the new resource and click the \"Add\" button. Associate selected agent s  with existing resources All existing resources across your agents and jobs will appear in alphabetical order. Select one of three states for all resources you want to associate and then click the \"Apply\" button. A resource with a check will add the resource to all selected agents. A resource with a hyphen means some of your selected agents are associated to it. No change will occur after clicking \"Apply\". A resource without a check will remove the resource from all selected agents. Agent states GoCD will tell you if it loses touch with agents. If GoCD server doesn't hear from an agent for two minutes, the agent will turn red in the Agents tab, and GoCD will tell you the last time it heard from the agent. GoCD will also transparently re-assign the build to the next available agent that can run it, if the lost agent was building a job. GoCD will also let you know if one of the agents it knows about has never contacted it since GoCD server was last started. In this case, the agent's state will be marked as \"missing\" and it will be gray. If an agent is working on a job, it will turn orange, and display the name of the job it is working on. You can click on the job description to go to the job details page for that job: Removing agents If you want to remove an agent from GoCD's build cloud, go to the agents tab, locate the agent you want to remove, and click on the button marked \"Disable\". GoCD will record in its configuration that this agent should be excluded from the build cloud. If you restart Go server, the agent will continue to be disabled. Disabled agents do not count towards GoCD's licensed agents. To permanently remove an agent from Go's configuration, you can use the agent api or delete from the agents tab. The agent must be disabled before it can be deleted Following this procedure, if you restart the agent, GoCD server will see it as a new agent, and you can enable it again in the same way as described above. Pausing agents If you want to pause an agent or temporarily disable it so that GoCD server will not assign work to the agent. GoCD will record in its configuration file that the agent has been disabled. This means, if you restart GoCD server, the disabled agent will remain disabled. You can use the following api to disable agents or you can disable the agent from the agents tab. A disabled agent can be enabled; this will make it eligible to pick up work again. You can use the api or enable an agent from the agents tab. Details of a single agent GoCD now provides a page that shows the details of a single agent. This page provides details about the agent configuration and the history of all the jobs that ran on that agent. Agent Details tab This tab shows the configuration and runtime information of an agent. For example, this tab shows the free space available on the agent, the IP Address and the OS of the agent. In terms of configuration, this tab shows the resources of the agent and the environment it belongs to. A sample Details tab looks as below: Job Run History tab You must be logged in as an admin user to configure this step. This tab shows a table of all the completed jobs that ran on this agent. A sample page is shown below For every job, the following columns are shown: Pipeline: The pipeline to which the job belongs to Stage: The stage to which the job belongs to Job: The name of the job Result: The result of the job - Passed, Failed, Cancelled or Rescheduled Completed: The date when the Job completed Duration: The duration that the Job took to finish - from scheduled till completed. The job listing table can be sorted on any column, except for the Duration column. Using Agent details to debug agent issues This page is useful to figure out if there are agent issues and hence a certain job keeps failing on that agent. Consider a job which runs functional tests for a web application that need a browser to be available. The job was passing so far and only recently it has started to fail intermittently. Here are the steps you can follow to figure out if this is an agent issue. Navigate to the job details page of the given job that failed. Locate the \"Agent\" label and click on the link to the agent Navigate to the \"Job Run History\" tab Sort on the Job Name and locate the job that just navigated from You'd notice that the job started to fail recently. You can even see if there are other jobs that have started failing around the same time by now sorting on the Completed date."},{"title":"Managing Artifacts and Reports","description":"Managing artifacts and reports in GoCD","keywords":"GoCD configuration, artifacts, reports, publishing artifacts, artifact repository, test artifacts,","href":"/configuration/managing_artifacts_and_reports.html","content":"Managing artifacts and reports Because all your work is done on remote agents, GoCD provides a mechanism for files to be automatically uploaded to GoCD server following the completion of every job. These files can then be accessed via the GoCD server dashboard, or via the RESTful API. Publishing artifacts The first step in using the artifact repository is to tell GoCD which files you want to publish. To do this just specify the path to the file or directory relative to the root of the source control checkout. You also need to specify where GoCD will publish the artifact. You can add as many files and directories as you like. To configure an artifact: Navigate to Admin → Pipelines Edit the pipeline you want to configure artifacts for Expand the left tree navigator and click on your job Click on the Artifacts tab Enter the source  where the artifact will be found  and destination  where the artifact should be saved on the Go server For power users, here's how you would configure this via Config XML:    Using tabs Once your artifacts are safely in GoCD server's artifact repository, you can have the dashboard display them in tabs. GoCD can display images, text files, or anything else that a browser will normally render in an IFrame. If you display an html page which references other resources  such as images, Flash files or whatever , so long as the resources are referenced with relative paths, they will display correctly. This mechanism is a simple way to include reports  for example code coverage  in Go. Example The console tab shows output information from all the phases of the job. This also includes information from the version control system and details regarding the artifacts created and published during the job. If you produce an html page with an embedded Flash file into your artifact repository: You can use the following configuration to display it in a tab:    GoCD will create a tab called \"Recording\" and display the contents of the file in the tab when you click on it: Publishing tests GoCD has support for publishing tests from JUnit or NUnit test reports. To configure a test artifact: Navigate to Admin → Pipelines Edit the pipeline you want to configure artifacts for Expand the left tree navigator and click on your job Click on the Artifacts tab Enter the source  where the artifact will be found  and destination  where the artifact should be saved on the Go server From the Type dropdown, select Test Artifact For power users, here's how you would configure this via Config XML:    GoCD will: add a tab called Tests that lists the tests in the project add a list of the failed tests to the Failures tab set the properties associated with tests on the job. These include failed-test-count, ignored-test-count, test-time and total-test-count copy the artifacts into the repository.

In particular, you may want a pipeline to trigger based on the result of a stage in another pipeline. This is possible by adding pipelines as materials. Creating a dependency Say we have two pipelines - upstream_pipeline and downstream_pipeline . We want downstream_pipeline to automatically trigger following the successful completion of the stage AutoStage1 in pipeline upstream_pipeline. Here's how we'd achieve this: Navigate to the Admin section. On the Pipelines screen, locate the downstream_pipeline    pipeline and Edit it. Click on the Materials tab. Add a new pipeline dependency material by clicking Add Material and then selecting Pipeline . You'll be presented with an Add Material popup  see screenshot Enter upstream_pipeline [AutoStage1] in the Pipeline [stage] field  it can also auto-complete Power users can also configure this via the Config XML tab on the Admin section  Configuration reference is here :              ... Now, when the stage \"AutoStage1\" of \"upstream_pipeline\" completes, the pipeline \"downstream_pipeline\" will start building. If you want to view the materials that are associated with \"downstream_pipeline\", the pipeline details page for that specific instance of the downstream pipeline will show you all this information. Fetching artifacts from an upstream pipeline GoCD can automatically fetch artifacts from a previous stage of the current pipeline or from any ancestor pipeline it depends on. This is useful when a pipeline depends on binaries that are produced earlier in the pipeline. Note that you can not specify two  or more  dependencies for the same upstream pipeline. For example, in the following configuration, when the stage \"AutoStage1\" of pipeline \"upstream_pipeline\" passes, the pipeline \"downstream_pipeline\" starts, and the artifacts are fetched from the upstream pipeline in the stage 'Stage' of \"downstream_pipeline\". You can see the exact pipeline and stage that triggered this in the sub-tab 'Materials' on the stage details page. You can do this via the admin screens for the respective pipelines. You'll need to first define the artifact in the \"upstream_pipeline\" at the job level: Then, you'll want to retrieve  fetch  that artifact from within the \"downstream_pipeline.\" You can do this by creating a \"Fetch Artifact\" task within a job in that pipeline. Since you have already defined \"upstream_pipeline\" as a dependency material, artifacts from that pipeline are accessible in this pipeline. A fetch task can also be instructed to retrieve  fetch  an artifact from an ancestor pipeline. For example, lets assume that the \"upstream_pipeline\" used in this example, depends on another pipeline \"topmost_pipeline\". Then you can define a a \"Fetch Artifact\" task to fetch artifacts from \"topmost_pipeline\" by defining the hierarchy of these pipelines as follows. You have to specify the hierarchy by separting the pipelines with a /. For example: topmost_pipeline/upstream_pipeline. For power users, here's how you can configure this via the Config XML tab on the Admin section  Configuration reference is here :              ...                                                                                          ...                                                                                                                                                                      ..."},{"title":"Managing Environments","description":"Managing environments","keywords":"GoCD configuration, GoCD environments, pipeline groups, agents, UAT environments, performance testing environment, production environment, deployment pipeline","href":"/configuration/managing_environments.html","content":"Managing environments GoCD is configured using an XML configuration file.

You can also edit the full XML file if you wish, by clicking on the Config XML section of the Administration tab. Creating a new environment An Environment is a grouping of pipelines and agents. By assigning an agent to an environment, it will be used to run only those jobs that belong to the pipelines of that environment. An agent can belong to more than one environment. This means, for instance, the same agent can be used to deploy something into an UAT or a Performance testing environment. A pipeline can, however, only be assigned to a single environment. Generally, these pipelines represent the tasks that need to happen in a given environment. For example deploying a 3-tier application into an UAT environment with 6 machines and running smoke tests on the setup. However, once an agent is associated with one or more environments, it is no longer capable of picking up jobs on pipelines that do not belong to environments. Pipelines outside of environments will only be assigned to agents in the default pool  not associated with any environment . You can create an environment in the admin UI through the following steps. This example creates a production environment, adding the deployment pipeline and the agent installed on the production server. Click on the Environments tab Click on the \"Add a new environment\" Provide a name for the environment Add one or more pipelines that need to run on the environment Add one or more agents associated with the environment Add one or more environment variables or secure environment variables that need to be passed.

There are Secret Managers in the market which specialize in solving some of these problems around handling secrets. Leveraging these solutions, GoCD provides plugin endpoints to lookup for secrets defined in an external Secrets Manager. This gives GoCD users the flexibilty to use a Secret Manager of their choice to store and manage secrets. At no point the external secrets are stored in GoCD, these secrets are looked up only when required, e.g if a job is configured to use external secrets, these secrets are looked up just before the job is assigned to an agent and transmitted securely to the agent. How to use external secrets in GoCD Step 1 - Install a Secrets Plugin To look up for secrets from an external Secrets Manager you would need to install a Secrets Plugin which supports a Secret Manager of your choice. A list of available Secrets Plugins can be found here. GoCD comes bundled with a Secrets Plugin which encrypts and stores secrets on a file. For more information about the File based Secrets Plugin please refer to the documentation. Step 2 - Configure a Secret Manager A Secret Manager should be configured to lookup for secrets. A Secret Manager can be configured using the Secret Configuration, this configuration is specific to a plugin and would differ based on the plugin used. Steps to configure a Secrets Manager, the below example uses the bundled File based Secrets Plugin, Login into your GoCD server. Go to Admin menu → Secret Management. Click on Add button. Enter a unique id for secret configuration. This id will be referred in GoCD configurations while using the secrets. In the Plugin dropdown select the plugin which supports a Secret Manager of your choice. Once a plugin is selected an appropriate configuration is displayed below. Provide the path to the secrets file on the GoCD server. The secrets file plugin's documentation has information about how to generate a secret file and manage secrets. Step 3 - Restrict usage of Secrets Manager There can be cases wherein Admins might want to restrict the usage of Secret Manager or the secrets defined within a Secrets Manager. E.g  restrict usage of production secrets to a specific pipeline or environment. GoCD allows Admins to control usage of a Secret Manager through Allow or Deny rules. Rules define strict access control for a Secrets Manager. Users can define two types of rules Allow - Explicitly allows usage of the Secret Manager to a GoCD entity. my_first_pipeline Deny  - Explicitly denies usage of the Secret Manager to a GoCD entity. resource_identifier The rules have the following attributes, Attribute Description type This attribute represents the type of GoCD config entity, can be either pipeline_group or environment. To represent any entity type use the wildcard  * . action This attribute represents the allowed action on the Secret Configuration, currently the only allowed action is refer. resource The name of resource. Should be the name of a pipeline_group or environment since they are the only supported values for the type attribute. By default if no rule is defined, none of the GoCD entities will have access to the Secret Manager. Hence the Secret Manager would be unusable. Step 4 - Define Secret Params Once a Secret Manager is configured, you will have to define a Secret Param to lookup for a secret from an external Secrets Manager. The syntax of a Secret Param is: {{SECRET:[secret_config_id][secret_key]}} where, secret_config_id: is the unique id provided while creating secret configuration. secret_key: is the key which refers to a secret value stored in your external Secrets Manager. Add a Secret Param Currently, GoCD allows Secret Params to be added in the following places, Password field for an SCM Material Value field of an environment variable. Secret Params defined anywhere else other than the above would be ignored and treated as a string. Secret Param resolution Secrets from an external Secrets Manager are never stored in GoCD, hence the Secret Params are resolved just before they are required. Secret Params defined as a password in a SCM Material are resolved just before a Material is picked up for an update. Secret Params defined as an environment variable is resolved before assigning work to an agent. If a Secret Param resolution fails the corresponding task would fail as well. This can lead to a failed job or a failed material update. More about Rules A restrictive model is followed while accessing a Secrets Manager. In the absence of a rule, a Secret Manager is inaccessible by default. The secret config defined in the example cannot be referred by any entity in GoCD.   All secrets for env1           ...       Wildcards  *  in type: Using a wildcard  *  for type implies a given rule applies to all entity types. In this case, the supported entities are pipeline_group and environment. In the given example, a Secret Configuration can be referred by any pipeline_group or environment with the name production.   production Note: type can have a wildcard *  but it will not support pattern matching e.g. pipe*. Wildcards  *  in action: Using a wildcard  *  for action implies a given rule applies to any action on the Secret Config. Currently refer is the only supported action. Note: action can have a wildcard *  but it will not support pattern matching e.g. ref*. Wildcards  *  in resource: Resource name supports the wildcard characters '?' and '*' to represent a single or multiple  zero or more  wildcard characters.

Pipelines in GoCD can poll packages in repositories similar to how they poll version control systems. A build typically consumes source code maintained in a version control system  VCS/SCM . What about a typical deployment? Increasingly, the input for deployments is the build result packaged as: jar, war or ear file in case of Java nuget/ chocolatey package in case of .NET Linux system package  e.g rpm, deb  in case of any application platform Other application level package formats like gem, npm, phar, wheel etc. These files  packages  are often maintained in corresponding package repositories. Such packages may be specified as materials for GoCD pipelines. Supported Packages Since there are many package formats each with its own package manager and repository, the support for package-as-material has been implemented as an extension point. Using the bundled yum-repo-poller plugin, it is possible to specify an rpm package held in a yum repository as a material for a GoCD pipeline. Using other external plugins, it is possible to do the same for other types of packages. Repositories, Packages and Materials A repository may contain one or more packages. A pipeline may refer to a package as a material. When the package is updated in the repository, interested pipelines will get scheduled. Repository Definition A package material plugin lets pipeline group admins provide details of the corresponding repository type to GoCD. e.g. here is how we define a yum repository using the bundled yum-repo-poller plugin. Note: The repository name is not used by the package material plugin - it is used by Go to construct the material name. Two package repositories cannot have the same name. Use the check connection button to ensure that Go can work with this repository. Package Definition A package material plugin also lets you define packages at the time of pipeline material configuration  Admin > Material >Add Material > Package . Here is what it looks like for defining RPM packages with the bundled yum plugin. The package name is not used by the package material plugin - it is used by Go to construct the material name. Two packages in a repository cannot have the same name. Use the check package button to ensure that the package definition does indeed resolve to the package you are looking for. Unlike other VCS/SCM materials, the material definition in case of packages is not contained within the pipeline definition. Many pipelines may have material definitions referring to the same package. Here is how we associate an existing package as material for a pipeline. Note: Each package definition must resolve to exactly one package on the repository, else the pipeline will not run. In order to set up a pipeline that polls for multiple packages, configure each package as a separate material. Each package material plugin defines a subset of its properties as a package fingerprint. e.g. in case of the bundled yum plugin this subset consists of Repository URL and Package Spec  it excludes repository username and password . Repository and Package names are not part of package fingerprint. It is not permitted to multiple packages having the same package fingerprint. An attempt to do so will result in an error message like this: The following error s  need to be resolved in order to perform this action: Cannot save package or repo, found duplicate packages. [Repo Name: 'orchard', Package Name: 'apple'], [Repo Name: 'orchard', Package Name: 'orange'] Sample XML Configuration Here is a XML view of an RPM package definition. Note the relation between repository, package and pipeline material. Loosely typed property, key and value tags are used for repository and package configuration in order to accommodate different plugins. If you choose to configure via direct XML edit, note that it isn't necessary to provide repository and package IDs, Go server will autogenerate them. However, not all validations that are performed while configuring via UI kick in while configuring via XML edit - the resulting failures will show up later in the server health message panel at the bottom right of the browser frame.                  REPO_URL       http://public-yum.oracle.com/repo/OracleLinux/OL6/latest/x86_64                                           PACKAGE_SPEC           gcc-4.*                         ...                       ... Value stream modeling tip Depending on whether GoCD is also publishing the package or just consuming it, there are two options for modeling a value stream that includes packages. The first scenario is where the package is published from some pipeline in GoCD. Say pipeline X publishes package P to an external repo and pipeline Y consumes P. To trigger Y after publication of P, there are two options: Pipeline dependency: X becomes a material for Y. Y resolves the exact version of P and downloads it on its own  although this tip may be used to pass package version information from X to Y . X will appear as an upstream component of Y in the value stream map. Package material: Y adds P as a package material. Y no longer has to resolve P. It isn't advisable to do both as Y will then schedule twice. The choice depends on how closely the activities in pipeline X and Y are related. If it is important to see X and Y together in the same value stream map, then option #1 makes sense. The second scenario is where GoCD does not know about how/who published the package. Perhaps it got published by a job in Jenkins. Or perhaps the package is an open source package on a public repository on the internet. In this case the only option is to use a package material. GoCD helps you trace back to the external origin of the package if the package creator adds trackback information to the package metadata. The details of this will vary by plugin. In case of the bundled yum plugin, we use the URL field in rpm metadata for this. Permissions Repositories and their packages are global entities not tied to a pipeline group or environment. Pipeline group admins may define repositories and packages for use in their pipelines. One pipeline group admin may also use packages defined by another for their pipelines. Changing a package definition will cause all dependent pipelines to schedule - even those not in the same pipeline group as that of the person editing. Because of this, we don't have a UI way of changing the definition of a package. Only the GoCD admin can change it via Admin > Config XML tab. Polling Even if no pipelines use a package, GoCD polls for newer packages every minute. This may be turned off at a package level by setting autoUpdate to false via the config xml  GoCD admins only . autoUpdate is turned on by default. When a newer package is found, the pipelines for which it is a material get scheduled  assuming auto scheduling of pipelines is on . Also see API scheduling. Package information display The following information is expected from the package material plugin  which in turn obtains it from the package metadata if available Package revision  e.g. gcc-4.4.7-3.el6.x86_64 Package build time Name of package creator  if available Package comment Trackback URL - Typically an absolute URL that indicates what job  in GoCD or otherwise  created the package. Package - material name  i.e. repo-name:package-name At the time of building the package, it is recommended to include as much of the above information as possible so that it is available for Go to display as below. Downloading the package The package isn't automatically downloaded on the agent and made available to the jobs. This is unlike VCS/SCM materials where a checkout is made by default. In case of packages, the GoCD Agent is typically not the target node for deployment, it is only orchestrating deployment to a remote node. So, instead of an automatic download, the following environment variables are made available: GO_PACKAGE___LABEL GO_REPO___REPO_URL GO_PACKAGE___LOCATION Repository and package names are converted to all uppercase and hyphens are converted to underscores before inclusion in the environment variable names. For example, let's say we set up a repository named ORA pointing to http://public-yum.oracle.com/repo/OracleLinux/OL6/latest/x86_64 and define a package gcc with a spec of gcc-4.* and set it up as material for a pipeline. To download the package locally on the agent, we could write a task like this: [go] Start to execute task:  -c curl -o /tmp/gcc.rpm $GO_PACKAGE_ORA_GCC_LOCATION When the task executes on the agent, the environment variables get subsituted as below: [go] Start to execute task:  -c curl -o /tmp/gcc.rpm $GO_PACKAGE_ORA_GCC_LOCATION . ... [go] setting environment variable 'GO_PACKAGE_ORA_GCC_LABEL' to value 'gcc-4.4.7-3.el6.x86_64' [go] setting environment variable 'GO_REPO_ORA_GCC_REPO_URL' to value 'http://public-yum.oracle.com/repo/OracleLinux/OL6/latest/x86_64' [go] setting environment variable 'GO_PACKAGE_ORA_GCC_PACKAGE_SPEC' to value 'gcc-4.*' [go] setting environment variable 'GO_PACKAGE_ORA_GCC_LOCATION' to value 'http://public-yum.oracle.com/repo/OracleLinux/OL6/latest/x86_64/getPackage/gcc-4.4.7-3.el6.x86_64.rpm' ... Or, to simply pass it as an argument to a deploy script on a remote server     -c     ssh server \"cd /to/dest/dir;deploy.sh $GO_PACKAGE_ORA_GCC_LOCATION\" Also see Installing RPMs Important: Please note that if you change repository credentials and then try to re-trigger  redeploy  an old package, the published environment variables will not reflect new credentials. Publishing a Package At the moment, GoCD does not create or publish the package for you. But it is simple enough for each type of package. e.g. rpm You could also explore the command repository on GitHub for helpful commands. What is command repository? Please see this. Package Dependencies Please note that GoCD does not support any sort of automatic polling or other support for package dependencies. Each package dependency has to specified as a separate material if needed. Alternatively, just poll for the packages at the root of the dependency graph and let the package manager figure out the rest at the time of installation. e.g. if componentA-1.2.0-b234-noarch.rpm depends on componentB-2.3.0 or above, simply poll for componentA and let yum install componentA-1.2.0-b234-noarch do the resolution of componentB for you."},{"title":"Plugin User Guide","description":"GoCD plugins allow users to extend the functionality of GoCD's continuous delivery server.","keywords":"gocd plugins, jenkins plugins, gocd plugins installation, gocd plugins uninstallation","href":"/extension_points/plugin_user_guide.html","content":"GoCD Plugin User Guide Introduction Plugins allow users to extend the functionality of GoCD. Each plugin is assigned an identifier which is determined by the id attribute provided in plugin metadata file packaged along with the plugin jar. If the metadata file is not packaged, plugin jar file name will be taken as plugin id. Plugins are classified into two categories - Bundled and External. During startup, GoCD server would try to load all the plugins. On successful load, the plugin will be converted into an OSGi bundle and extracted into /plugins_work directory. Plugins tab, under GoCD server Administration, would list all the loaded plugins. Bundled versus External Bundled Plugins: As the name suggests, bundled plugins are bundled/packaged along with GoCD server. These are developed and supported by Thoughtworks GoCD development team. Bundled plugins are located under /plugins/bundled directory. After an upgrade, when GoCD server starts up for the first time, all bundled plugins would be refreshed with the latest packaged versions. External Plugins: All user authored plugins are treated as external plugins. Unlike bundled plugins, external plugins are not altered  read packaged/bundled/refreshed/removed/modified  during a GoCD server upgrade. External plugins are loaded from /plugins/external directory. Listing of external plugins Installing and Uninstalling of plugins You need access to the GoCD server machine to be able to install/uninstall a plugin. To install a plugin, drop the plugin jar under the external plugin directory   /plugins/external   and restart GoCD server. To uninstall a plugin, remove the plugin jar from the external plugin directory   /plugins/external   and restart GoCD server. Plugins Tab Plugins tab can be found under GoCD server Administration. Plugins tab shows all the plugins that have been loaded currently along with its details and status. If a plugin is marked invalid or incompatible, the reasons for the same would be reported here. Notes Add/delete/upgrade of a plugin will take effect only after a GoCD server restart. Two plugins cannot have same id irrespective of whether it is a bundled or an external plugin. If two external plugins with same id are available, only one of them will be loaded successfully in no specific order. If a bundled and an external plugin with same id are available, only bundled plugin wll be loaded."},{"title":"SCM Extension","description":"GoCD has built-in support for Git, Mercurial, SVN, TFS & Perforce.

GoCD server interacts with this plugin via package material plugin interfaces. The plugin makes use of a command similar to the following to poll the server. So it does not depend on the files that yum depends on e.g. files under /etc/yum.repos.d repoquery --repofrompath=uuid,$REPO_URL --repoid=uuid -q $PACKAGE_SPEC -qf \"%{LOCATION}...\" A given instance of polling is considered successful if repoquery returns a single package as output. Repository definition Repo URL must be a valid http, https or file URL. This plugin looks for the presence of $REPO_URL/repodata/repomd.xml to ascertain validity. Basic authentication  user:password@domain/path  is supported for http and https repositories. Package definition In case of this plugin, the package definition is completely determined by the package spec. The package spec may be in any of the following formats. Please refer the repoquery man page for details. name name.arch name-ver name-ver-rel name-ver-rel.arch name-epoch:ver-rel.arch epoch:name-ver-rel.arch Shell glob patterns may also be used. For example, say we have a component under development getting ready for release of version 1.2.0. We cut a branch for the release and bump up the version on trunk/master to 1.3.0. Thus, a package generated by trunk/master may look like mycomp-1.3.0-b72349-noarch.rpm while that generated by branch may look like mycomp-1.2.0-b72344-noarch.rpm. Now if we have a deployment pipeline that is only interested in 1.2 series packages, the package spec needs to be mycomp-1.2.* rather than just mycomp.

Creating and Publishing RPMs Although the support for package as material in GoCD isn't concerned with how the packages are created and published, here is a short set of pointers to information on the web. Building an RPM using rpmbuild and SPEC file Building using fpm Tutorial to set up a local yum repository using createrepo. Publishing to a yum repo simply involves uploading/copying over a new package revision at the correct location and running createrepo --update Notes This plugin will detect at max one package revision per minute  the default interval at which GoCD materials poll . If multiple versions of a package get published to a repo in the time interval between two polls, GoCD will only register the latest version in that interval. This plugin makes use of buildtime in rpm metadata to determine if a poll has returned a new result. If for some reason  e.g. timezone misconfiguration , the buildtime of pkg-1.1 is less than that of pkg-1.0, then the plugin will not register pkg-1.1 as a newer package. The only way to update an rpm is to change the version or release. Republishing a different file with the same name and different buildtime won't do. Package groups are not supported. The GoCD command repository has a bunch of commands related to rpm packages."},{"title":"Running out of Disk Space","description":"When run of of space, GoCD stops scheduling new pipelines by compressing large files, attaching a larger hard drive, or by deleting unused artifacts.","keywords":"Disk space, schedule pipelines,","href":"/faq/admin_out_of_disk_space.html","content":"Running out of disk space After you've had GoCD running for a while, you may notice the following warning box when browsing GoCD: If you don't do anything about it, you'll end up seeing the following error: GoCD will stop scheduling new pipelines until you make more room, either by compressing large files, attaching a larger hard drive, or by deleting unused artifacts. You could also let GoCD manage artifact disk space by enabling auto purge of old artifacts. Auto delete artifacts Introduction GoCD can be configured to automatically delete artifacts if the available disk space on the server is low. GoCD will purge artifacts when available disk space is lower than the given value. Artifacts will be purged upto the point when available disk space is greater than a defined value. Configuration Specify artifact purge start and end limits You must be logged in as an admin user to configure this step. Navigate to the Admin section on the GoCD dashboard.

Never delete artifacts for a stage You must be logged in as an admin user to configure this step. You can disallow deletion of artifacts from a particular stage so that those artifacts are excluded during deletion. This option can be set in the stage editor for a pipeline. This option can be set for stages that are important so that artifacts for the stage are preserved. Navigate to the admin section on the GoCD dashboard. Navigate to the pipelines section and choose a pipeline to edit Navigate to the stage settings for the stage 4.Check the box 'Never Cleanup Artifacts' Also see... Managing artifacts and reports Clean up after cancelling a task Compress large log files In many cases, the easiest thing to do is compress some of the larger artifacts that you won't frequently have need for. For example, if you have a large log file named 'test.log' and you're running GoCD server on a unix machine, the following script will gzip those files that haven't been modified in the last 10 days find /var/lib/go-server/logs/pipelines -name test.log -mtime +10 -type f -exec gzip -v '{}' \\; Now, if you add this to a system crontab, your server can compress large artifacts automatically. Move the artifact repository to a new  larger  drive If compressing large artifacts is not giving you enough free space, another thing you can do is attach a larger disk drive to store artifacts. After the drive is attached to the system, we can easily change the location GoCD uses for it's artifact repository. Find the location of the GoCD configuration file Navigate to the Admin > Config XML tab section The location of the configuration file is listed here Install the new drive Shut down GoCD server Copy all files from the original artifact repository location to the new drive Change the artifact repository location in the configuration file     ... Start up GoCD server and verify you still have access to old artifacts Delete unused artifacts Another option for making more room is to remove unused  or easily recreatable  artifacts. You may also have old pipelines that you no longer need. The directory structure of the artifact repository makes selecting which artifacts are safe to delete easier.

For example, code and tests are checked in as part of the same commit. But code is built and tested in sequence, so the same material version has to be used for pipelines that build and test your code. This section covers some Dependency Management concepts and how GoCD handles certain complex scenarios. Propagate material revision throughout the dependency chain If you have frequent material updates coupled with long running dependent pipelines sharing that same material, you may encounter situations where the revision that triggered the dependency chain is no longer the latest revision. Go keeps track of what revision triggered a dependency chain and ensures that the same version propagates throughout all members of that chain. This helps ensure that all artifacts generated as part of that build share a common revision. Example Consider the following dependency chain: Legend SCM : Repository rev1, rev2 : Check-ins to the repository A : Pipeline for development build dependent B : Pipeline for acceptance tests How it works Code is checked in to SCM  rev1 Development build  A  is triggered by the check-in There is another check-in to SCM  rev2 Development build completes  with rev1  and triggers acceptance tests  B Here's where dependency management comes in. Go is smart enough detect that rev1 originally triggered the build and ensures that the acceptance tests check-out that revision  rev1  and not the latest revision  rev2 . In this situation, Go ensures that the appropriate version of acceptance tests are run against the appropriate version of the development build."},{"title":"Deploy a Specific Build","description":"Deploy specific revisions of the materials to an environment using GoCD","keywords":"deploy, revision, material, deployment pipeline","href":"/faq/deploy_a_specific_build_to_an_environment.html","content":"Deploy specific revisions of the materials to an environment GoCD allows you to hand pick which revision of your materials you would like to deploy to your environment. This is a a very common requirement on larger projects which have multiple materials in their deployment pipeline. Sometimes you may wish to have control over which revision of the application is deployed to a particular environment  say UAT . Select specific revisions of materials to deploy Consider the case where a deployment pipeline 'deploy_bookstore' has 2 materials - Material 'svn' and upstream pipeline 'bookstore'. It is very common to know that label, say \"3.4-RELEASE\" of the dependent pipeline 'bookstore' is stable. All the changes that you want right now in your UAT environment are made to material 'svn'. In such a scenario when you deploy \"deploy_bookstore\" to UAT, you might always want to select label \"3.4-RELEASE\" of pipeline 'bookstore' and the latest  or a known revision specified by your developer  of material 'svn'. Once there are any new changes to any of the materials, Go will indicate to the user that newer revisions are available to deploy. You could use this information and deploy a custom build with hand picked revision or deploy the latest available revision. Steps to select the revisions of materials you want to deploy Navigate to the Environments page and locate the specific deployment pipeline you are interested in. Click on \"Deploy Specific Revision\". This gives you the list of available revisions for each material Click on the \"Revision to Deploy\" search box. This will list latest 5 revisions/labels of your materials ordered by time of check-in  latest check-in on top Select the revisions of all the materials that you would like to pick for deployment. You can search for the revision you want by revision hash/pipeline label check-in comment user If you do not select a specific revision of a material, then the currently deployed revision will be retained. Before clicking on \"Deploy Changes\", check the \"To Deploy\" column to verify which revision will be deployed. Click \"Deploy Changes\" to start the deployment. Why is the 'Deploy Changes' button disabled? There are 3 reasons this can happen There is a deployment in progress, so another one cannot be started Your deployment pipeline is operating in locked mode You do not have sufficient permissions to operate on that pipeline Deploying the latest of all materials If you always want to have the latest of all materials deployed to your environment, then this is how you can use Go to do it. Click on deploy latest This will trigger the deployment pipeline This will pick up the latest available revision of your materials at the time the pipeline is scheduled Using passwords while deploying You can set secure variables in Go that gets passed along as environment variables to the executing task. You can use this feature to pass passwords to deploy scripts. For e.g., you can define a secure variable named 'DB_DEPLOY_PASSWORD' and the DB password as its value. This value will be encrypted by Go and passed along to the task. Also, you can override secure variables when you use the 'Trigger With Options' feature."},{"title":"See artifacts as sub-tabs","description":"See artifacts as sub-tabs in GoCD","keywords":"artifacts, configuration, GoCD stage, GoCD job, broken build","href":"/faq/dev_see_artifact_as_tab.html","content":"See artifacts as sub-tabs in GoCD After uploading html reports, it is often useful to be able to easily view this information when trying to understand why the build is broken.

Depending on the kind of process used in the task, environment variables are accessed differently. Presented below are some common usage scenarios, with the assumption that a job has been configured with an environment variable called ENV_VAR_1, with the value VALUE_1. 1. Using an environment variable in a custom command on Unix/Linux A very common use case for environment variables is to use them as arguments for a custom command \"exec task\" in GoCD . Assuming that you want to pass the environment variable ENV_VAR_1 to the ls command, you might be tempted to try something like this: Figure 1: Wrong usage of environment variable in custom command task  Will not work When run, it will end with a message like this: Figure 2: Result of wrong usage of environment variable in custom command task As you can see, the environment variable, $ENV_VAR_1 was passed in literally to the command ls and was not interpolated. What is happening here is that GoCD is directly executing the command and passing in the parameters, without involving a shell like bash or sh in the middle. When a command such as ls $ENV_VAR_1 is executed from the command-line, the shell process is the one that interpolates the environment variable and replaces it with its value, so that the ls command does not see it. So, we need to do the same here. The correct way to invoke this, so that the interpolation of the environment variable works is like this: Figure 3: Correct usage of environment variable in custom command task When run, it will end with a message like this: Figure 4: Result of correct usage of environment variable in custom command task Even though the command failed in this example, the value of the environment variable was interpolated. You can replace ls with some other command, but the concept remains the same. 2. Using an environment variable in a custom command on Windows This is easier than using it in a shell script because, on Windows GoCD agents, commands are executed by wrapping them in cmd /c. So, environment variables get interpolated automatically. So, with a configuration such as this: Figure 5: Usage of environment variable on Windows When run, it will end with a message like this: Figure 8: Result of usage of environment variable on Windows Similarly, it works when used in a batch file  say, \"env_var.cmd\" , with content such as this: echo Environment variable ENV_VAR_1 is: %ENV_VAR_1% Notice that, unlike on Unix/Linux, the way to access an environment variable on Windows is to use %, instead of $. 3. Using an environment variable in a shell-script - On Unix/Linux Using an environment variable inside a shell-script is not special at all. You can directly use it, as you would any environment variable. For instance, a shell-script with this content, will work when executed normally: #!/bin/sh echo \"Value of environment variable ENV_VAR_1 is: $ENV_VAR_1\" This works when executed directly, with a config such as this: Figure 9: Usage of environment variable in a shell-script When run, it will end with a message like this: Figure 10: Result of usage of environment variable in a shell-script 4. Using an environment variable in a ruby script Again, using an environment variable inside a ruby script is not special at all. This has been mentioned here, just to show that scripts written in different languages have to use different mechanisms to access environment variables. A ruby script such as this works as expected: #!/usr/bin/env ruby puts \"Environment variable ENV_VAR_1 has the value: #{ENV['ENV_VAR_1']}\" Standard GoCD environment variables The examples above mention a custom environment variable set at the job level. However, there are some standard environment variables available during every job run, set by GoCD. They are: Environment Variable Description Example contents GO_SERVER_URL Base URL for the GoCD server  including the context root https://127.0.0.1:8154/go GO_ENVIRONMENT_NAME The name of the current environment. This is only set if the environment is specified. Otherwise the variable is not set. Development GO_PIPELINE_NAME Name of the current pipeline being run main GO_PIPELINE_COUNTER How many times the current pipeline has been run. 2345 GO_PIPELINE_LABEL Label for the current pipeline. By default, this is set to the pipeline count  this can be set to a custom pipeline label 1.1.2345 GO_STAGE_NAME Name of the current stage being run dev GO_STAGE_COUNTER How many times the current stage has been run 1 GO_JOB_NAME Name of the current job being run linux-firefox GO_TRIGGER_USER Username of the user that triggered the build. This will have one of three possible valuesanonymous - if there is no securityusername of the user, who triggered the buildchanges, if SCM changes auto-triggered the buildtimer, if the pipeline is triggered at a scheduled time changes GO_DEPENDENCY_LABEL_${pipeline name or material name} The label of the upstream pipeline  when using dependent pipelines . Non alphanumeric characters are replaced with underscores  \"_\" . For example, upstream pipeline \"pipeline-foo\" becomes: GO_DEPENDENCY_LABEL_PIPELINE_FOO. In case material name is specified, for example material \"foo\" becomes: GO_DEPENDENCY_LABEL_FOO 1.0.3456 GO_DEPENDENCY_LOCATOR_${pipeline name} The locator of the upstream pipeline  when using dependent pipelines , which can be used to create the URL for RESTful API calls upstream/1.0.3456/dev/1 GO_REVISION The current source control revision being run  when using only one material 123 GO_REVISION_${material name or dest} If you are using more than one material in your pipeline, the revision for each material is available. The environment variable is named with the material's \"materialName\" attribute. If \"materialName\" is not defined, then \"dest\" directory is used. Non alphanumeric characters are replaced with underscores  \"_\" . 123 GO_TO_REVISION If the pipeline was triggered with a series of source control revisions say 121 to 123 , then this environment variable has the value of the latest revision  when using only one material . This is always same as GO_REVISION. 123 GO_TO_REVISION_${material name or dest} If you are using more than one material in your pipeline, the 'to' revision for each material is available. The environment variable is named with the material's \"materialName\" attribute. If \"materialName\" is not defined, then \"dest\" directory is used. Non alphanumeric characters are replaced with underscores  \"_\" . 123 GO_FROM_REVISION If the pipeline was triggered with a series of source control revisions say 121 to 123 , then this environment variable has the value of the oldest revision  when using only one material 121 GO_FROM_REVISION_${material name or dest} If you are using more than one material in your pipeline, the 'from' revision for each material is available. The environment variable is named with the material's \"materialName\" attribute. If \"materialName\" is not defined, then \"dest\" directory is used. Non alphanumeric characters are replaced with underscores  \"_\" . 121 GO_MATERIAL_HAS_CHANGED A boolean value indicating if the material revision has changed since the previous run  when using only one material true GO_MATERIAL_${material name or dest}_HAS_CHANGED When more than one material is configured for your pipeline, a flag would be available for each of the materials available to denote if the corresponding material's revision has changed since the previous run. The environment variable is named with the material's \"materialName\" attribute. If \"materialName\" is not defined, then \"dest\" directory is used. Non alphanumeric characters are replaced with underscores  \"_\" . false Use current revision in a build It is often useful to use the current version control revision number in your build. For example, you might want to use the svn version number in the name of your binary for tracing purposes. GoCD makes much of this information available to your build scripts as environment variables. Example usages One material For this example, we are going to assume we are using a single Subversion repository for our source control system and we have a job set up to call the ant target \"dist\". Add the following target to your ant build.xml               Now, when GoCD runs the 'my-app' pipeline on revision 123, the file deploy-123.txt will be created, with the following content: deploy-123.txt Building pipeline my-app Multiple materials For this example we are going to assume we are using a Subversion repository containing the code and a Mercurial repository containing configuration scripts. Ensure the pipeline materials look like this                   ... Add the following target to your ant build.xml                    Now, when GoCD runs the 'my-app' pipeline with the code at revision '123' and the configuration at revision '59cab75ccf231b9e338c96cff0f4adad5cb7d335', the file deploy-123.txt will be created with the following content: deploy-123.txt Building pipeline my-app Configuration version: 59cab75ccf231b9e338c96cff0f4adad5cb7d335 Pass environment variables to a job You can specify variables for Environments, Pipelines, Stages and Jobs. If a variable is specified more than once, the most specific scope is used. For example if you specify variable FOO='foo' for an environment, and FOO='bar' for a Job, then the variable will have the value 'bar' when the job runs. Setting variables on an environment You can add variables to an environment by editing the configuration of the environment. Click on the name of the environment to edit configuration. You specify variables on an environment in the Config XML by adding an  section to the environment definition.                           bar                               Variable values can have             multiple lines  assuming that your operating system supports this correctly .                                            <![CDATA[]]>                                      You can add variables for a job by editing the job configuration.

One of the popular methods to do so is configuring SSH keys. When using docker for gocd server and agents, it becomes slightly more complex to do this. Below are the steps to configure the ssh keys that can be used with multiple containers at once. Create a docker container using the gocd-server image: docker run -itd -v/some/location/on/host:/home/go/.ssh gocd/gocd-server:v18.12.0 Once the container has started, the container id is provided. Exec into the container as the go user docker exec -it -u go -w /home/go  /bin/bash Generate ssh keys for the go user. ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C \"something to identify this key: like an email address\" After executing the above command, you will notice that there are 2 files created in /home/go/.ssh called id_rsa and id_rsa.pub. id_rsa corresponds to the private key, which you will later provide GoCD to access the private repository with. id_rsa.pub is the public key that needs to be added to your SCM account. Follow the instructions provided below to add a new ssh key for your respective provider: Github: https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/ Bitbucket: https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/set-up-an-ssh-key-728138079.html Gitlab: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/create-your-ssh-keys.html Once the public key has been added to your account, try accessing a private repository by doing git clone on the private repository using the SSH protocol. Most SCMs provide the command to clone with SSH when you access the repository on the browser. A prompt appears when you execute the git clone command for the first time. Choose yes and continue with the cloning. This will create a file called known_hosts in /home/go/.ssh . Alternatively use the ssh-keyscan command to create known_hosts. ssh-keyscan [host] > /home/go/.ssh/known_hosts where [host] can be github.com, bitbucket.com, gitlab.com etc. The ownership and permissions of files in /home/go/.ssh is: -rw-------    1 go       go            3243 Jan 11 07:00 id_rsa -rw-r--r--    1 go       go             754 Jan 11 07:00 id_rsa.pub -rw-r--r--    1 go       go             407 Jan 11 07:01 known_hosts They should not be tampered with. On the host, the same files will be present as shown below: ls -l /some/location/on/host total 24 -rw-------  1 1000  1000  3243 Jan 10 23:10 id_rsa -rw-r--r--  1 1000  1000   754 Jan 10 23:10 id_rsa.pub -rw-r--r--  1 1000  1000   407 Jan 10 23:10 known_hosts The above is for linux. It can look slightly different if you have a user on the host with UID and GID 1000. For mac, it will look slightly different. Using in multiple containers Now that the ssh keys have been created for go, you can use them in different gocd servers and agents docker run -itd -v/some/location/on/host:/home/go/.ssh gocd/gocd-server:v18.12.0 docker run -itd -v/some/location/on/host:/home/go/.ssh gocd/gocd-agent-alpine-3.6:v18.12.0"},{"title":"Fixing common issues","description":"Troubleshooting common GoCD server and agent errors.","keywords":"gocd troubleshooting, installation errors gocd, agent not registering, ssl error, common issues","href":"/faq/fixing_common_issues.html","content":"Fixing common issues This page is mainly for newer users of GoCD, to help with troubleshooting issues.

The problem here is that the agent is not able to connect securely to the server, which points to an invalid certificate. This can happen if an agent has connected to one GoCD server and is then pointed to another GoCD server. It will try to connect to the new server using the certificate that was for the older server and it will fail. The resolution is to move or rename the agent.jks file found the in the config/ directory of the agent and restarting the agent. That should make it connect using the correct certificate. If you're using full end-to-end transport security, this error might mean that the server's certificate has changed and you need to provide the update certificate.

The reasons for this can be: No agent is available  free and not building . Check the \"Agents\" page to see if all agents are busy. If so, once one of them becomes free, then this build will start. If you do see available agents, then check whether the job has resources defined in its config. If so, it means that the job is looking for an agent with those resources. Check the \"Agents\" page to see whether there are agents which have the resources needed by the job and are available  not building . If the previous two options don't solve the problem, check whether the pipeline is a part of an environment  in the \"Environments\" page or in the config . If it is, then any agent that can pick up a job from that pipeline needs to be a part of that environment as well. GoCD SPA Pages - There was an unknown error performing the operation.

By default, polling occurs every minute and ten materials at a time. The polling interval and the number of materials to be polled simultaneously are configurable. GoCD uses SCM commands to poll for changes. For example, to check for any new changes in SVN repository the following command is used: svn log --non-interactive --xml -v -r HEAD:'revision' 'repository-URL' The SCM command used by GoCD server can hang with no output. Invalid configuration, network issues, console input block are some of the causes for such a situation. Such scenarios cause pipeline scheduling delays and also lead to performance degradation Such a scenario is notified to the users by a warning in Server Health; when clicked shows a message similar to the one below. What can I do with the information When you see warning messages like the one above Identify the processes running as children of GoCD Server On Windows, you can use tools like Process Explorer . On linux you could run 'ps waux | grep 'material-type'' Determine the process that's hung. The extra information like URL: https://test@bitbucket.org/test/git_repo.git in the warning information should help you with this. On linux system, you should see lines like these: go 31201 1  0 Feb07 ?  00:00:00 git clone https://test@bitbucket.org/test/git_repo.git /var/lib/cruise-server/pipelines/flyweight/b9ec0885-eb32-458c-bd6b-eeefe3ef9816 Kill the process and all its children  the whole process tree .

Now with the \"Trigger with options\" functionality, it is possible to trigger a pipeline with older materials. In this case, the changes to the material as reported by the repository and the order of pipelines containing these changes are not the same Example Order of check-ins retrieved from Hg log: changeset:   10689:6dbb27e86dc9 branch:      trunk tag:         tip user:        ShilpaG date:        Tue Apr 27 09:52:15 2010 +0530 summary:     fixing twist test EnvironmentScreenPermissions changeset:   10688:2b5b25a68117 branch:      trunk user:        JJ date:        Tue Apr 27 08:45:29 2010 +0530 summary:     fixing broken twist test changeset:   10687:6f91bbb648fa branch:      trunk user:        PS date:        Mon Apr 26 15:28:16 2010 +0530 summary:     #3889 - Added the twist test for the stage details actions.

This is the order in which they were triggered. The pipeline order based on natural order: 1, 3, 2. This is because, if we look at the changes in each pipeline instance, 1 has the earliest set of revisions, 3 has the next set of revisions and 2 has the latest revisions in that particular repository  material . The above example works when there is one material. If the pipeline has multiple materials, GoCD examines the timestamps of all the materials to determine which is logically the earlier pipeline instance. In this case, the earlier instance is the one that has the earliest time stamp across all the materials. GoCD supports natural ordering of materials when we \"Trigger with Options\". The user can change the revision of all materials or where one particular material that is likely to have broken the build  is chosen and all other materials are pinned to a particular revision last known good revision ."},{"title":"Deploy to an environment","description":"One of the most useful aspects of having your build mapped as a pipeline, is being able to know exactly what is in a particular environment.","keywords":"gocd environment build pipeline, cd pipeline, user accepting test, deployments","href":"/faq/rm_deploy_to_environment.html","content":"Releasing into an environment One of the most useful aspects of having your build mapped as a pipeline, is being able to know exactly what is in a particular environment.

This section identifies the approaches and the drawbacks to keep in mind when using these approaches. Docker in Docker  DinD Docker in Docker involves setting up a docker binary and running an isolated docker daemon inside the container. This requires that the host docker container be run in privileged mode. The privileged flag enables the host container to do almost all of the things that the underlying host machine can do. We have provided the GoCD Agent DinD image that can be used to run docker related tasks in a GoCD agent. Drawbacks: As explained by jpetazzo in his blogpost, there are some cases where DinD may not work for you. Additionally, there is a security risk of running a container in privileged mode as well. Docker Outside of Docker  DooD Docker outside of Docker involves volume mounting the host's docker socket onto the GoCD agent container and use the host's docker daemon to execute docker related commands from the CI. This requires the docker binary to be installed in the gocd agent image because the Docker Engine is no longer distributed as  almost  static libraries. This can be achieved by doing: docker run -it -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -e GO_SERVER_URL=\"https://:8154/go\"  Drawbacks: Maintaining a custom gocd agent image with docker. Name conflicts may occur if there are two containers with the same name that the GoCD agents bring up. Consider the cleanup of the containers after a build completes. The GoCD agent container is brought up and down by an elastic agent plugin. However containers brought up by these ephemeral GoCD agents for build and test are not automatically terminated by the plugin at the end of a build. They must be explicitly cleaned up before the GoCD agent is brought down. In addition, layers of images are cached and reused. Build isolation is lost. The containers brought up this way are outside of the helm scope and not easily accessible. Using a single docker GoCD agent image In cases where DinD and DooD both don't work for your use case, an alternative is to package all the build time dependencies into a single docker image. Use this docker image with the GoCD Elastic Agents to run the builds. This works only if you are not choosing to containerize your application builds and tests. In other words, this works well for a workflow that doesn't involve running docker related commands using elastic agents."},{"title":"Install the GoCD Helm chart","description":"The GoCD Helm Chart page explains how to get started with GoCD for kubernetes using Helm.","keywords":"gocd helm chart, cd pipeline","href":"/gocd_on_kubernetes/helm_install.html","content":"Getting Started with GoCD on Kubernetes Step 2: Install the GoCD Helm chart Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes.

This section uses GoCDs pipelines as code capability to import sample pipeline definitions from an external Git repository. Prerequisites The sample pipelines build a sample application as a Docker image artifact and publish it to Dockerhub. To do this, make sure you have a Docker Hub account. GoCD's pipelines as code configurations allow for the scripting of pipeline definitions. These do not include global objects like artifact stores. Global objects need to be setup using the GoCD user interface or the API. This sample requires an artifact store configured so pipelines can publish and fetch Docker image artifacts to it. You can configure a new DockerHub artifact store with the Admin -> Artifact Stores menu. You can now configure the artifact store with your DockerHub credentials. To setup Dockerhub credentials, select the registry type: Others  Dockerhub, GCR, private The Docker registry URL for Dockerhub is https://index.docker.io/v1 Enter your Dockerhub user credentials. Setup secrets For deployment pipelines that need access to the Kubernetes API for target deployment Kubernetes clusters, an API token must be provided and made available to deployment scripts. Deployment scripts also need other secrets such as Dockerhub credentials. We setup these secrets in Kubernetes and make them available to the GoCD agents in the elastic agent's pod yaml configuration. Kubernetes API Tokens To allow a deployment script to be able to communicate with the target Kubernetes cluster, you must create a service account for deployments. The API token for this service account can then be stored in a Kubernetes secret. Refer the Kubernetes RBAC guide for instructions on creating service accounts and assigning them to roles. You can create a secret with these credentials with the following Kubernetes configuration: cat <./secrets-for-gocd.yaml apiVersion: v1 kind: Secret metadata:   name: secrets-for-gocd type: Opaque data:   K8S_API_TOKEN:    DOCKERHUB_USERNAME:    DOCKERHUB_ORG:  EOF Encoding note: The serialized JSON and YAML values of secret data are encoded as base64 strings. Newlines are not valid within these strings and must be omitted. The following pipeline will strip newlines before base64 encoding strings. echo -n \"string\" | base64 Apply the secrets-for-gocd.yaml file to create a secret with these credentials kubectl apply -f secrets-for-gocd.yaml -n gocd Configure the elastic profile. The sample pipelines are configured to use GoCD Kubernetes elastic agents. Elastic agents are build agents that are provisioned on-demand for a job and terminated thereafter. Elastic agents use elastic profiles to provision these on-demand agents. A Kubernetes elastic profile includes information about the container image for the GoCD agents, and the pod configuration yaml. The GoCD Helm chart sets up an elastic profile after installation. To view this elastic profile configuration, navigate to Admin > Elastic Profiles. The GoCD elastic agents need to be configured with secrets such as a Kubernetes API token to allow it to be able to perform deployments of applications to the cluster. We configure the secrets created in the previous step in the configuration of the elastic profile mentioned earlier. Replace the pod yaml with one below. apiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata:   name: pod-name-prefix-{{ POD_POSTFIX }}   labels:     app: web spec:   containers:     - name: gocd-agent-container-{{ CONTAINER_POSTFIX }}       image: gocddemo/gocd-agent-dind:webinar       env:         - name: KUBE_TOKEN           valueFrom:             secretKeyRef:               name: secrets-for-gocd               key: K8S_API_TOKEN         - name: DOCKERHUB_USERNAME           valueFrom:             secretKeyRef:               name: secrets-for-gocd               key: DOCKERHUB_USERNAME         - name: DOCKERHUB_ORG           valueFrom:             secretKeyRef:               name: secrets-for-gocd               key: DOCKERHUB_ORG         - name: NAMESPACE           valueFrom:             fieldRef:               fieldPath: metadata.namespace       securityContext:         privileged: true Setup external pipeline configuration repository GoCD pipelines can be defined in code in either YAML or JSON format. These pipeline definitions can be stored in a source code repository, either in your application's repository or a separate repository. The GoCD sample pipelines build and publish an image of a sample nodejs application called 'Bulletin Board'. These pipeline configurations are available in the repository: https://github.com/gocd-demo/sample-k8s-workflow You can add a new configuration repository with the Admin -> Config Repositories menu. You can now configure the location of the repository ies  to pick up pipeline definitions. Note: The PluginID dropdown allows you to select either the JSON or YAML configuration plugin, based on the format of your pipeline configuration. Imported sample pipelines Once imported, the dashboard page should display the sample pipelines.

Build and publish image This pipeline builds an application artifact and publishes it to an artifact store. The material A GoCD pipeline's material is the trigger for a pipeline. Often it is a source code repository. It could also be another GoCD repository. A change in a material causes a pipeline to run. The material for the build_and_publish_image pipeline is a Git repository. When the pipeline is imported, the material is rendered on the Value Stream Map page as the trigger for the build_and_publish_image pipeline. Stages and jobs In GoCD, stages and jobs are workflow constructs that allow for sequential or parallel execution of build tasks. The build_and_publish_image pipeline has one stage called build_and_publish_image with one job called build_image. Clicking on a stage or a job on the GoCD user interface shows you the results of execution of the stage and its constituent jobs. Job details The build_image job builds a Docker image artifact for the sample application. It then publishes the Docker image to a Docker registry configured under Admin -> Artifact Stores. Elastic profile The elastic_profile_id assigns this job to an elastic profile. When this job is triggered, an elastic agent is provisioned based on the elastic profile and is assigned to this job. External artifacts The external artifact configuration in the job definition uses the Docker registry artifact plugin to push the docker image to the Docker registry once it is built. The console tab for the build_image job shows this interaction. 2. Test application This pipeline fetches the Docker image built in the previous build_and_publish_image pipeline and runs tests against it. The material The material for the test_application pipeline is the previous build_and_publish_image pipeline. By specifying a pipeline material, test_pipeline will be triggered whenever the previous build_and_publish_image pipeline completes successfully. The test_application pipeline can also reach out and fetch any artifacts that the build_and_publish_image pipeline generates and stores on the GoCD server. Note: Build artifacts could either be stored on the GoCD server or an external artifact store like a Docker registry. Stages and jobs The test_application pipeline has one stage called test_app_image with one job called test_app_image. The stage details page shows the result of exection of the stage and its constituent jobs. Job details GoCD build agents run as Docker In Docker containers. The test_app_image job fetches the application's Docker image and runs the application's test command on an application container. It does so by executing the docker run command. Elastic profile The elastic_profile_id assigns this job to an elastic profile. When this job is triggered, an elastic agent is provisioned based on the elastic profile and is assigned to this job. Fetching artifacts The fetch task is configured with the application image to be pulled from the Docker registry configured under Admin -> Artifact Stores. This interaction is shown in the console tab of the test_app_image job. 3. Deploy to cluster This pipeline deploys an application artifact to a Kubernetes cluster. The material The deploy_to_cluster pipeline has two materials. The first material is the previous test_application pipeline. The second material is a Git respository where the deployment scripts are stored. The deploy_to_cluster pipeline will be triggered either on successful completion of the upstream test_application pipeline, or on a commit to the Git repository material. Stages and jobs The deploy_to_cluster pipeline has one stage called deploy_to_cluster with one job called Deploy. The stage details page shows the result of exection of the stage and its constituent jobs. Job details The Deploy job fetches the application's Docker image metadata and makes it available for use in the environment. It then calls a deployment script to deploy the application to Kubernetes. Elastic profile The elastic_profile_id assigns this job to an elastic profile. When this job is triggered, an elastic agent is provisioned based on the elastic profile and is assigned to this job. Fetching image metadata Since deploying to Kubernetes doesn't require the application image to be pulled down to the build agent, the fetch task is configured to fetch the application image metadata. The metadata is then made available for further tasks in the job. This interaction is shown in the console tab of the deploy job. Access your application Once the pipeline has run successfully, go to http:///bulletin-board to see your deployed sample application. Getting the new ingress IP address for the deployed application: For Minikube: minikube ip For other Kubernetes implementations: echo \"http://$ kubectl get ingress bulletin-board-ingress --namespace $NAMESPACE -o jsonpath=\"{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0]['ip']}\" \" Check the status of agents with Agent Status Report When the pipeline is running  signified by a yellow bar , you can take a look at the status of the agents that are assigned to run the jobs in the pipeline. You can find the following information here: Pod details & configuration Pod events Logs for the agents This can be useful to troubleshoot when an agent is not picking up the job. To access the agent status report: Click on a stage of your choice when the pipeline is being built. You'll see the stage detail page with a list of jobs. Click on the job that you wish to see the agents of. This is the job detail page which has a console log. Click on the button titled 'Check Agent Status'. Clicking on this will take you to the Agent Status Report. The Events and Logs tabs display the GoCD elastic agent pod events and logs. Note: The Agent Status Report is only visible when a job is running. Once the job completes, this status is no longer visible."},{"title":"Setup and configuration","description":"The GoCD Helm Chart page explains how to get started with GoCD for kubernetes using Helm.","keywords":"gocd helm chart, cd pipeline","href":"/gocd_on_kubernetes/setup_and_configuration.html","content":"Getting Started with GoCD on Kubernetes Step 1: Setup your Kubernetes cluster Before you can get started with GoCD on Kubernetes, make sure that you have taken a look at the list below. 1.

To create a service account for Tiller with the rather permissive cluster-admin role, create a file called rbac-config.yaml with this content: apiVersion: v1 kind: ServiceAccount metadata:   name: tiller   namespace: kube-system --- apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind: ClusterRoleBinding metadata:   name: tiller roleRef:   apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io   kind: ClusterRole   name: cluster-admin subjects:   - kind: ServiceAccount     name: tiller     namespace: kube-system Note: The cluster-admin role is available by default in a Kubernetes cluster, you don't have to create it. kubectl create -f rbac-config.yaml Now that we have the Helm service account created and assigned to a role, let's deploy Tiller with this service account. helm init --service-account tiller Refer the Helm RBAC guide for more secure and advanced RBAC configurations."},{"title":"Configure an agent with proxy","description":"Tip and examples on how to configure an agent to communicate with the server through a proxy server","keywords":"proxy server, gocd agent server proxy","href":"/installation/configure-agent-proxy.html","content":"Configure a GoCD agent to connect to a server through a proxy server.

However, we recommend that you create a separate partition on your computer's hard disk for GoCD server artifacts. The artifact repository can grow in size very quickly. If located on your system's main partition you may experience data loss and unpredictable application behaviour as the disk fills up. Once you have created a new disk partition, you need to tell GoCD where to find it. Click on \"Server Configuration\" tab of the \"Admin\" tab. GoCD to the \"Pipeline Management\" section. Specify the artifacts directory location and click on \"Save\" Power users can also configure this via the Config XML tab on the Admin section:      ...

When you have entered this information, click \"Save\" to save the configuration file. You can change the artifacts directory location at any time using the method described above, even when GoCD is running. However GoCD will not move existing artifacts to the new location for you, and changing the location while GoCD is running won't take effect until GoCD Server is restarted. If you decide to move your artifact repository, the safe way to do it is: Pause all pipelines and wait until all active jobs on the agent grid has completed  all agents are in the state \"idle\" Shut down GoCD server Copy the artifact repository to the new location Edit GoCD's configuration file manually as described above to tell GoCD where to find the artifacts Restart GoCD server Even when all active jobs on the agent grid have stopped, users may still be uploading artifacts using the RESTful URLs. This is why we need to stop GoCD server completely in order to be safe. Configure site URLs Click on \"Server Configuration\" tab of the \"Admin\" tab. GoCD to the \"Server Management\" section. GoCD generates URLs that are relative to the base URL of the request. However, there are scenarios, such as sending emails, generating feeds where GoCD cannot rely upon publishing URLs relative to a request.

The hardware specifications will depend on the current needs and future expansion plans. Also see: GoCD system requirements Agent hardware requirements The agent hardware requirements are basically determined by the builds that are run. Running GoCD agents will introduce a slight CPU overhead  usually it can be neglected when comparing to the build process CPU requirements . The agent will require an additional memory of about 500Mb. Although, you may run the agent on the same machine as the server, it is recommended that you use a separate machine  though, it may be virtual  for each build agent. If you chose to install several agents on the same machine, please consider possible CPU, disk, memory or network bottlenecks that might occur. Server hardware requirements The GoCD Server is responsible for performing a number of tasks and we describe how each of these tasks affects the specifications: Number of web-requests to the server Number of agents connected to a GoCD server, and how often they build Number of source control materials Type of source control materials, some types perform better than others Number of times each of the pipeline has run  pipeline history Number and types of plugins that may be installed Number of web-requests to the server Web-requests to the server come from different kinds of sources browsers requests from end users  most pages in GoCD continuously poll the server every few seconds to check if the page has updates on it API calls from programs CCTray which is popularly used by dashboard apps and other desktop apps to notify devs about failing builds usually poll every few seconds and are fairly expensive calls on the server GoCD uses a shared thread-pool to manage a lot of web requests from several users, if you have a lot of users, consider adding more cores based on the number and type of request you serve per minute. You can find out the number of requests that your server is handling by turning on web-request logging. Number of agents connected to a GoCD server, and how often they build Each GoCD agent that is connected to the server will poll the GoCD server every few seconds and to update its status on the server and check if there are any jobs that it should build. When a build starts off on an agent, it will first perform an SCM checkout operation to update to the correct revision that must be built. If the job requires that artifacts from other dependent jobs be downloaded, the agent will download the artifacts from the server. During a job run, the agent will send the console logs every few seconds and at the end of the build, an agent may upload artifacts to the server if it is configured to do so. To cope up with the number of agents, artifact uploads and downloads, ensure that the server has - enough disk space to store the artifacts enough consistent IO baseline throughput to be able to handle simultaneous uploads and downloads from several agents at the same time enough cores to be able to handle web requests from agents Note: it is perfectly allright to host the GoCD artifacts on a network file share. However ensure that your network file share can provide a consistent IO throughput. A high load on the network file share may also cause your web-requests to slow down, if they use the same network port. It helps with quicker artifact upload and download if the server and agents are geographically co-located. This will help reduce the latency between the agent and server. Number of source control materials GoCD uses up-to 10 processes  configurable  to check if updates are available for source control materials SCM . Only materials that have polling turned on will be polled. Each material is checked approximately every minute for to see if there are updates available so that GoCD can trigger a build. If you have hundreds of SCMs, depending on the performance of your source control updates, the update checks for SCMs may queue up and negatively affect the performance. Ensure that - your SCM server s  can handle the load of several SCM checkout and update operations  both from the server and the agent there is enough IOPS, IO throughput, memory and cores available to ensure that you can poll all your SCMs without the update checks queueing up, or eating away too many resources that would otherwise be used by the GoCD server process. You can find out the amount of time it takes to perform an SCM update check by turning on performance logging on your GoCD server. If you find that material updates are taking too much of your CPU time, you may try one or more of these options - turn off polling for materials that don't update frequently reduce the interval between polls notify the GoCD server of material updates, instead of polling it investigate if upgrading the SCM software version resolves the issue Type of source control materials, some types perform better than others All SCMs need to connect to a remote SCM repository to check if updates are available. Some of them are more efficient at update checks than others. SCMs like git and mercurial require a local clone to be able to check if there are new commits and the contents of those commits, as such they will have additional overhead in terms of IO and disk space usage. On the other hand, SCMs like SVN and TFS don't require a local checkout to check for updates, so they may not have a disk IO overhead on the gocd server. However the number and frequency of since a material update check may cause a bottleneck on the network. Number of times each of the pipeline has run  pipeline history Each pipeline run  along with the stages and jobs in it  is recorded in the database for purpose of audits. To ensure optimal performance of your GoCD server we recommend that you run your database server on a separate instance Number and types of plugins that may be installed Each plugin that is installed on the server will consume additional memory on the memory and may have an impact on the CPU utilization of the server. Task plugins, will consume additional on the memory usage of the gocd agent process and may affect the CPU usage of the gocd agent process. This may require that users change the heap -Xmx  and/or metaspace -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize . Definitions For the purpose of the rest of this document, we would like to use the following definitions: Cores The number of physical compute units available to the server machine. A note about hyper-threading: While hyper-threading makes a single physical core to look like 2 logical cores, the performance improvement, in most cases, the performance is somewhere around 15% of a single core. Memory JVM Memory The amount of memory available to the JVM running the GoCD server process  roughly the -Xmx JVM argument RAM The amount of memory available to the server machine. Generally speaking, the amount of RAM should be atleast 2-3GB more than the JVM memory to allow some headroom for the operating system. A note about swap: Ensure that swap is turned off, because it negatively affects performance when the machine runs out of memory and begins swapping Buffer Cache Reading from a disk is very slow as compared to reading from memory. Additionally, it is common to read the same part of a disk several times during relatively short periods of time. For example, consider how often the command git might be run on a GoCD server. By reading the information from disk only once and then keeping it in memory until no longer needed, one can speed up all but the first read. This is called disk buffering, and the memory used for the purpose is called the buffer cache. Generally speaking, you should ensure that there is sufficient free memory for buffer cache to ensure optimal performance and reduced disk IO. [root@fmtgocdgo01 ~]# free -m              total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached Mem:         11912      11633        278          0         20       2128 -/+ buffers/cache:       9484       2427 Swap:            0          0          0 In the example above, the first line says that the amount of free memory is \"278\" mb, this makes it look like the system is running short of memory. However the second line -/+ buffers/cache  shows that in reality 2427 mb is actually free. This is because about 20+2128 megs of memory is buffers + cache, which the OS can purge if it is programs request for more memory. IOPS The amount of input/output operations per seconds of your storage device. IO throughput Usually expressed as Megabytes / Second  MB/s , indicates the amount of data that a server can read and/or write in a given amount of time. Usually, higher the IOPS, the higher the throughput."},{"title":"Installing GoCD agent on Linux","href":"/installation/install/agent/linux.html","content":"Installing GoCD agent on Linux Installation of the GoCD agent using the package manager will require root access on the machine.

It also highlights some configurations which need to be taken care of when scaling GoCD. Minimum server requirements The minimum requirements for a GoCD server can be found here Scaling GoCD As the number of pipelines, agents and concurrent users increase in your setup, GoCD server may have to be scaled up by adding more memory and cores. If you have questions or have custom requirements, please contact support@thoughtworks.com to help with capacity planning for GoCD server Things to Remember Do not run any other CPU intensive applications on the same box as the GoCD Server. When the GoCD server is being scaled up to run with larger number of pipeline, agents and materials, ensure that the JVM has been allocated appropriate heap sizes. The default values for the GoCD server are -Xms512m  minimum  and -Xmx1024m  maximum . To utilize more heap space, set the JVM option -Xmx to a higher value  for e.g. to use 8 GB heap, set the flag -Xmx8g . This flag can be set in the file wrapper-properties.conf on the GoCD server to add the system properties described above. See the installation documentation for the location of wrapper-properties.conf file. # use minimum JVM heap of 4gb wrapper.java.additional.100=-Xms4g # use maximum JVM heap of 8gb wrapper.java.additional.2=-Xmx8g For linux/unix users running large setups, an exception might be seen in go-server.log mentioning \"Too many open files\". This may be an indication that there is a need to increase the number of file descriptors on the machine where GoCD Server is installed. On linux the command ulimit -n can be used to check the total number of file descriptors. To bump up the total number for file descriptors user and system, follow these steps: Edit /etc/security/limits.conf and add the lines: soft nofile 1024 * hard nofile 65535 Edit /etc/pam.d/login, adding the line: session required /lib/security/pam_limits.so The system file descriptor limit can be increased by setting fs.file-max in the file /etc/sysctl.conf. To set the limit to 65535 use echo \"fs.file-max = 65535\" >> /etc/sysctl.conf Tuning your JVM Ensure that the latest JVM is used always, as there are major performance improvements with every release. The minimum and maximum JVM heap space allocated to the GoCD server affects its performance. GoCD uses default values of 512m and 1024m for minimum and maximum JVM heap sizes respectively. However, for production environments, we recommend setting the minimum and maximum values to an identical value. The default heap settings mentioned above are for a 32-bit JVM. But if the GoCD server is facing performance issues we recommend doubling the values in the heap settings and measuring performance. If its seen that more than 3 GB of heap memory is needed, we recommend a switch to 64-bit JVM. Our tests show that GoCD server performs much better on a 64 bit JVM than a 32 bit JVM provided the heap memory has been increased appropriately. This is needed because 64-bit JVM makes use of 64-bit addresses instead of 32bits, allowing it to use more memory. Start with the default settings and increase the heap memory incrementally to suit your application. Storage For optimal performance in artifact transfer GoCD would need storage with good disk I/O throughput. We recommend local storage for GoCD database and artifacts. Disk space can be reclaimed through deletion of historical artifacts. If using network storage is preferred, ensure that the speeds and throughput are good. Use RAID Configuration for higher throughput if the GoCD Server is expected to be an intensive setup. If you expect to have large artifacts you could use use different RAID configurations for GoCD database and artifacts. For example, 2 drives on RAID1 can be be used for the GoCD database  for redundancy , 3+ hard drives on RAID5 can be used for artifacts so that access to database and artifacts is optimized. Improving Server Startup Time The start up time for a very large GoCD Server instance could be improved by delaying material polling and pipeline scheduling to a few seconds after the server starts up. This would allow the server to warm up and cache some of the data before it is bombarded with threads that poll for material updates and pipelines that need to be scheduled. Following are the JVM properties that enable such a delay: cruise.material.update.delay - This value is specified in milliseconds. It has a default value of 10,000. This means that material polling would only start 10s after the server starts. cruise.produce.build.cause.delay - Likewise, this value is also specified in milliseconds. It again defaults to 10,000 meaning that scheduling of pipelines would take place only 10s after the server starts up. The two values above do not affect the frequency of material polling or pipeline scheduling. Troubleshooting Enable GC Logging An easy way to check the memory usage, heap size  initial and over time  and GC metrics of the application is by turning on GC logging. GC logging can be enabled using the following JVM arguments while starting the application  Note: the log file specified as file is reset each time the VM starts. -verbose:gc -Xloggc:file -XX:+PrintGCTimeStamps In case of the GoCD server, these arguments will have to be added in the script that starts the Go jar: For linux : /usr/share/go-server/server.sh For Windows: [go_server_installation_dir]/server.cmd In most cases GoCD is installed in C:\\Program Files\\Go Server Using JConsole JConsole is a graphical monitoring tool to monitor Java Virtual Machine  JVM  which comes as part of the JDK installation. It can be used to monitor the current state of a process without much overhead. If the GoCD server's performance is slow, some metrics can be immediately analysed using jconsole. Since jconsole is a graphical tool, make sure you have an access to display, when running the following command. That is, use ssh -X or VNC if GoCD is on linux. Use remote desktop if the GoCD server is on windows. $ jconsole Select the local process go.jar when the jconsole GUI opens up. This shows the current heap memory usage, threads, cpu usage etc. Screenshots of the VM Summary and the overview page can be taken to be sent to the GoCD Support team, if required. Please note that in case of linux, jconsole will have to be started as 'go' user. In Windows, starting the process as administrator should suffice. More information about jconsole can be found here. CPU and memory profiling Yourkit java profiler is a recommended tool for profiling the CPU and memory of the GO Server. To start using yourkit, download the latest version of the Yourkit java profiler from http://www.yourkit.com/download/index.jsp. Unpack to [yourkit_profiler_directory] The following steps will enable the GoCD server to pick up the yourkit profiler agent and enable us to take memory and cpu snapshots. For Linux Create a symlink for libyjpagent.so file to /usr/lib/yourkit folder. When the GoCD server starts up, it looks at this folder to see if it needs to start with profiling enabled or not. If you want to change the default path of the yourkit agent, you can edit server.sh at /usr/share/go-server/server.sh $ sudo ln -s [yourkit_profiler_directory]/bin/linux-x86-32/libyjpagent.so /usr/lib/yourkit/libyjpagent.so For 64-bit JVM, the command is: $ sudo ln -s [yourkit_profiler_directory]/bin/linux-x86-64/libyjpagent.so /usr/lib/yourkit/libyjpagent.so Restart the server after this, and the yourkit agent should get picked up by the server VM. Let the server start up and agents get registered. For Windows By default, GoCD server looks for the yourkit profiler agent yjpagent.dll in the location C:\\yjpagent.dll. Therefore, copy the file yjpagent.dll  which is the yourkit profiler agent  from [yourkit_profiler_directory]\\bin\\win32 to C:\\yjpagent.dll. Copy the file from [yourkit_profiler_directory}\\bin\\win64 if you are using 64 bit JVM. To change the above mentioned default location: define environment variable YOURKIT_PATH with value equal to location of yjpagent.dll. If you are running the GoCD server as a service, you will need to perform an additional step. In the config folder of the GoCD server installation, edit the wrapper-properties.conf file, and add an additional property with the following value \"-agentpath: [Path to yjpagent.dll]=port=6133,builtinprobes=none\" For example, if there are 16 properties already defined, add this 17th property as shown below wrapper.java.additional.17=\"-agentpath:C:\\yjpagent.dll=port=6133,builtinprobes=none\" Use the following steps to take profile the application and take snapshots. The hostname mentioned here is the hostname of the GoCD Server. In most cases, it would be 'localhost'. The value of port is 6133, because GoCD starts the yjpagent on port 6133. To start profiling, run: $ java -jar [yourkit_profiler_directory]/lib/yjp-controller-api-redist.jar hostname port  start-cpu-sampling $ java -jar [yourkit_profiler_directory]/lib/yjp-controller-api-redist.jar hostname port start-monitor-profiling If memory allocation profiling is also required: $ java -jar [yourkit_profiler_directory]/lib/yjp-controller-api-redist.jar hostname port start-alloc-recording-adaptive Let the server run for some time till you start seeing performance problems. 30 mins of snapshot should give us enough data. To capture the snapshot - Run: $ java -jar [yourkit_profiler_directory]/lib/yjp-controller-api-redist.jar hostname port capture-performance-snapshot To capture memory snapshot $ java -jar [yourkit_profiler_directory]/lib/yjp-controller-api-redist.jar hostname port capture-memory-snapshot To stop profiling, run: $ java -jar [yourkit_profiler_directory]/lib/yjp-controller-api-redist.jar hostname port stop-cpu-profiling` $ java -jar [yourkit_profiler_directory]/lib/yjp-controller-api-redist.jar hostname port stop-monitor-profiling If memory profiling was turned on,s top it using the following command $ java -jar [yourkit_profiler_directory]/lib/yjp-controller-api-redist.jar hostname port stop-alloc-recording Once you're done profiling, run the following so that on the next GoCD server restart, the agent is not loaded into the JVM. In case of linux, run the following command: $ sudo rm /usr/lib/yourkit/libyjpagent.so In case of windows, delete the file C:\\yjpagent.dll. If you were using the variable YOURKIT_PATH, then remove the environment variable. These snapshots will be saved in the yourkit configured snapshots folder. They can be sent to the GoCD Support so that they can be examined to help find the root cause of the performance. Contact GoCD Support If the GoCD server continues to behave poorly, send us the following data. Database file cruise.h2.db. Stop the server and take a backup of the database. Location: Linux: /var/lib/db/h2db/cruise.h2.db Windows: [go_installation_dir]\\db\\h2db\\cruise.h2.db Log file go-server.log.

It is recommended to understand any breaking changes between the releases to see if they impact your upgrades in any way. Before you start Before you begin upgrading, it is recommended that you turn on maintainance mode on your GoCD server  available since version 19.1 . Maintainance mode can be turned on under Admin > Server Maintenance Mode Navigate to the backup page under Admin > Backups and take a backup. This may take several minutes, depending on the size of your GoCD database and configuration. The GoCD server acts as a repository for all your build artifacts. While it is not essential to backup the artifacts before an upgrade, it is good practice to make regular backups of this directory. You can configure where GoCD stores build artifacts. The following are the default locations of the artifacts if you have not customized its location: Operating System Location Linux /var/lib/go-server/artifacts Windows, Mac OS X ${GOCD_INSTALL_DIR}/artifacts Upgrading to the new version You do not need to stop the Agents to perform an upgrade. GoCD agents will automatically update to the correct version of the software. You do not need to upgrade the GoCD agents. Any builds in progress will be rescheduled, and the existing pipelines will complete as expected. We ensure that the installed server will remain compatible with a version of a GoCD agent that is atleast 1 year old. GoCD will perform upgrades of its configuration and database when it starts. This process may take some time for installations with a large number of historical builds  10 to 15 minutes on very large installations . If you suspect that there is a problem with the upgrade, check the go-server.log to see if there are any reported errors. This is a one-time migration and subsequent restarts will be much faster. Windows Run the GoCD installer. Make sure that you specify the same directory as your previously installed version. If you have changed the GoCD Server Windows service to run as a different user, you will need to repeat this configuration change. The installer will automatically start the service. Once GoCD completes its internal data changes, you should be able to see the GoCD webpage. Any existing Agents should automatically reconnect. Any builds in progress should continue, or be rescheduled. Linux Debian based distributions  i.e. Ubuntu Run the GoCD installer as described sudo dpkg -i /path/to/go-server-${version}.deb # OR sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install go-server RPM based distributions  i.e. RedHat Run the GoCD installer as described sudo rpm -Uvh /path/to/go-server-${version}.deb sudo yum upgrade go-server Macintosh OSX The Macintosh OSX edition of Go does not support upgrades.

Index Task Job Stage Pipeline Materials Pipeline Dependencies Fan-in and fan-out Value Stream Map Artifacts Fetching artifacts Agent Resources Environment Environment Variables Templates Task A task, or a build task, is an action that needs to be performed. Usually, it is a single command. The task shown in the image below is set to run the command ant -Dmodule=A compile, when executed by GoCD. Figure 1: Task Job A job consists of multiple tasks, each of which will be run in order. If a task in a job fails, then the job is considered failed, and unless specified otherwise, the rest of the tasks in the job will not be run. The job shown in the image below has three tasks. The ant task will be run first, followed by the rake task and finally, the shell script is run. Figure 2: Job Every task in a job is run as an independent program, and so, changes made by a task to any of its environment variables will not affect subsequent tasks. Any changes made by a task on the filesystem will be visible to subsequent tasks. Stage A stage consists of multiple jobs, each of which can run independently of the others. This means that GoCD can and does parallelize the execution of jobs in a stage. If a job fails, then the stage is considered failed. However, since jobs are independent of each other, the other jobs in the stage will be run to completion. The stage shown in the image below has two jobs, one which builds module A and another which builds module B. The success or failure of the first job cannot affect the success or failure of the second. Figure 3: Stage Pipeline A pipeline consists of multiple stages, each of which will be run in order. If a stage fails, then the pipeline is considered failed and the following stages will not be started. The pipeline shown in the image below has three stages, the first with two jobs, the second with three and the third with one. If the first stage fails, then the second and third stages will not be run. Figure 4: Pipeline Since an image of a pipeline can get quite big, the rest of this document will use a slightly smaller representation of a pipeline, which hides the jobs and tasks. This representation is shown below. Figure 5: Pipeline  small representation Materials and triggers or \"When do these tasks, jobs, stages and pipelines run?\" A material is a cause for a pipeline to run. Often, it is a source code material repository  Git, SVN, Mercurial, etc . The GoCD Server continuously polls configured materials and when a new change or commit is found, the corresponding pipelines are run or \"triggered\". There are different kinds of materials. Here's an example of a Git material. When a commit is made to the repository configured in the Git material, the pipeline gets triggered. Figure 6: Material - git Similarly, an SVN material is shown below. GoCD has support for many different kinds of source code materials, as well as a plugin endpoint for extending the kinds of materials it supports. Figure 7: Material - SVN A \"timer trigger\" is a special kind of material that triggers a pipeline at a specified time, or at specified intervals. Figure 8: Timer trigger A pipeline can even be configured with multiple materials. The pipeline shown below is configured with a Git material and an SVN material. When either repository has a new commit, the pipeline is triggered. Figure 9: Multiple materials Pipeline dependency material Materials really start becoming powerful when a stage in a pipeline is used as a material for another pipeline. In the image shown below, Stage 2 of Pipeline 1 is configured as a material for Pipeline 2. Whenever Stage 2 of Pipeline 1 finishes successfully, Pipeline 2 triggers. In a setup such as this, Pipeline 1 is called the Upstream Pipeline and Pipeline 2 is called the Downstream Pipeline. Stage 2 of Pipeline 1 is called the Upstream Dependency of Pipeline 2. Figure 10: Pipeline dependency - Last stage Any stage of a pipeline can be used as a material. In the image shown below, as soon as Stage 1 of Pipeline 1 finishes successfully, Pipeline 2 will trigger and start. Now, both Stage 2 of Pipeline 1 and Stage 1 of Pipeline 2 can run simultaneously. Figure 11: Pipeline dependency - Any stage Fan-out and fan-in A material is said to \"fan-out\" to downstream pipelines, when the material's completion causes multiple downstream pipelines to trigger, as is shown in the image below. The cause of a fan-out need not always be a pipeline dependency material. It can be any material. Figure 12: Fan-out A \"fan-in\" is when multiple upstream materials are needed to trigger a downstream pipeline, as shown in the image below. One important and interesting aspect of fan-in is that GoCD will ensure that the revisions of upstream pipelines are consistent, before triggering a downstream pipeline. In the image shown below, this means that if Stage 2 of Pipeline 1 is slow and Stage 1 of Pipeline 2 is quick, Pipeline 3 will wait for Pipeline 1 to finish before triggering. It will not trigger with an inconsistent or old revision of Pipeline 1, just because Pipeline 2 finished quickly. Figure 13: Fan-in Value Stream Map  VSM The Value Stream Map  VSM  is an end-to-end view of a pipeline, its upstream dependencies and the downstream pipelines it triggers. When deciding which pipelines to trigger, GoCD's fan-in and fan-out resolution will take care of all the dependencies consistently. For instance, in the image below, when a new commit is found in Repo 1  git , GoCD will not trigger Pipeline 5 immediately. It will wait for Pipeline 1 to trigger and finish successfully, then it will wait for Pipeline 4 to trigger and finish successfully. Finally, it will trigger Pipeline 5 with the same revision of Repo 1 that was used with Pipeline 1. Figure 14: VSM Artifacts Every job in Go can optionally publish \"Artifacts\", which are files or directories. After the job is run, GoCD will ensure that the specified artifacts are published and made available to the user, and other downstream stages and pipelines. A representation of artifacts is shown below. As shown, every job can have artifacts. In this case, the job on the top has two files and a directory as its artifacts and the job below it has two directories and a file as its artifacts. Figure 15: Artifacts Fetching artifacts GoCD provides a special task called a \"Fetch Artifact Task\", which allows artifacts to be fetched and used, from any ancestor pipeline - that is, any pipeline that is upstream of the current pipeline. GoCD will ensure that the correct version of the artifact is fetched, irrespective of anything else that might be going on in the system. In the image shown below, the jobs in Stage 1 of Pipeline 1 publish some artifacts. In Stage 2, a Fetch Artifact Task fetches the artifact published in Stage 1. Then, in Pipeline 2, a Fetch Artifact Task fetches an artifact published in Pipeline 1. Finally, in Pipeline 3, which is further downstream, a Fetch Artifact Task fetches an artifact from Pipeline 1, through Pipeline 2. Figure 16: Fetch Artifact Task Agent or \"Where do these tasks, jobs, stages and pipelines run?\" GoCD Agents are the workers in the GoCD ecosystem. All tasks configured in the system run on GoCD Agents. The GoCD Server polls for changes in material  this happens on the GoCD Server itself  and then, when a change is detected and a pipeline needs to be triggered, the corresponding jobs are assigned to the agents, for them to execute the tasks. Agents pick up jobs which are assigned to them, execute the tasks in the job and report the status of the job to the GoCD Server. Then, the GoCD Server collates all the information from the different jobs and then decides on the status of the stage. An agent is represented by a monitor in the image below. Figure 17: Agent Resources Agents and jobs can be enhanced with \"Resources\". Resources are free-form tags, that help Go decide which agents are capable of picking up specific jobs. In the image below, the Firefox® and Tux icons represent resources on the agent. The resources can be thought of as the agent broadcasting its capabilities. Resources are defined by administrators and can mean anything the administrators wants them to mean. In this case, it might be an indication that this agent has Firefox installed for running functional tests and it is a Linux box. Figure 18: Resources on an agent Resources become very useful, when jobs are assigned resources. In the case of jobs, resources can be thought of as the capabilities they need in an agent, for them to be run successfully. In the image below, Job 1 claims that it needs an agent with the Firefox® resource. Job 2 claims that it needs an agent with the Linux® resource. Job 3 claims that it needs an agent with both Firefox® and Linux® resources. Job 4 claims that it doesn't need any resources. Figure 19: Agents, jobs and resources In the case of the image above: Job 1 can be assigned to either Agents 1 or 3, by the GoCD Server. Job 2 can be assigned only to Agent 1  since it is the only agent to provide the Linux resource . Job 3 can be assigned only to Agent 1  since it is the only agent to provide both those resources . Job 4 can be assigned to any of the three agents, since that job needs no special resource matching. Note that the fact that Agent 3 has an Apple® resource does not stop it from being assigned a job. It just happens to be a resource which is not needed by any of the jobs shown. Environments An \"Environment\" in GoCD is a way to group and isolate pipelines and agents. The rules of an environment are: A pipeline can be associated with a maximum of one environment. An agent can be associated with multiple environments or no environments. An agent can only pick up jobs belonging to pipelines in environments that it is associated with. An agent which is associated with an environment cannot pick up jobs in pipelines which are not associated with any environment. In the image below representing environments, Environment 1 is composed of Pipeline 1, Pipeline 2, Agent 1, Agent 2 and Agent 3. Environment 2 is composed of Pipeline 3, Pipeline 4, Agent 3 and Agent 4. Pipelines 5, 6 and 7 and Agent 5 do not belong to any environment. Figure 20: Environments In a case such as the image shown above: Jobs in Pipelines 1 and 2 can only be picked up by Agents 1, 2 and 3. Jobs in Pipelines 3 and 4 can only be picked up by Agents 3 and 4. Jobs in Pipelines 5, 6 and 7 can only be picked up Agent 5. In addition to the restrictions related to matching of Environments, resources need to match between the agents and jobs, as detailed in the section on Resources. Environment Variables Environment variables are often confused with \"Environments\". They're not directly related. In GoCD, \"Environment Variables\" are user-defined variables that are defined in the configuration. These environment variables are made available to tasks just like other environment variables available to processes when they run in an operation system. Environment variables can be defined at multiple levels: Within environments, within pipelines, within stages and within jobs. They follow a cascading system where environment variables defined at the \"Environment\" level get overridden by environment variables defined at the pipeline level and so on. In the image shown below, there are 4 environment variables defined at the environment level, 3 at the pipeline level and 2 each at the stage and job levels. The environment variable, ENV_ENV has been set to a value of 1 at the environment level, ENV_STG has been set to 2 at stage level and so on. Figure 21: Environment Variables The environment variables provided to every task in this job will be: ENV_ENV => 1 ENV_PIP => 2 ENV_STG => 3 ENV_JOB => 4 MY_VAR  => 4 For instance: ENV_PIP set at the environment level  to a value of 1  is overridden by ENV_PIP set at the pipeline level  to a value of 2 . Since ENV_PIP is not defined at the stage and job levels, the value of ENV_PIP will be 2. The other environment variables can be reasoned about in the same way.

With a single click, it allows you to trace a commit from when it is checked in up to when it is deployed. A value stream map can be drawn for every instance of a pipeline. It provides you with the ability to: See what caused the current pipeline to be triggered. See what downstream pipelines were triggered by the current pipeline. See the status of the current pipeline and all its upstream and downstream dependencies. See changes in dependencies of the pipeline across different runs of it. Along with all this, it also allows you to easily debug problems when a dependency/configuration change caused your build-test-release setup to break. Understanding the Value Stream Map The Value Stream Map is laid out as an end-to-end dependency graph. The graph originates from source control materials and flows from left to right. The pipeline instance for which the Value Stream Map is being viewed is the main pipeline and is highlighted. Everything to the left of this pipeline are its upstream dependencies, ie all the materials that have contributed to this instance. Everything to the right are its downstream dependencies, ie, all the pipelines that it can potentially trigger or contribute to. Upstream Dependencies The upstream dependencies of the main pipeline are taken from history and show all the source control and pipeline dependency materials that have contributed to the main pipeline. Even when the GoCD Configuration changes after a certain instance of a pipeline, its upstream dependency graph will continue to reflect the older configuration with which it was run. This also means that it would display pipelines that do not exist in the configuration any more. Let us assume that instance '1' of pipeline 'Build' is as below If the configuration changes to replace the pipeline 'Services' with 2 pipelines - 'Service-1' and 'Service-2', the next instance of pipeline 'Build' would reflect the change. Value Stream Map of pipeline 'Build' with counter '1' would look as below Downstream Dependencies The downstream dependencies of the main pipeline instance indicate what can happen with it. This information is always taken from the latest configuration. Pipelines that have not run yet are also shown If Environment-1 is removed from the configuration, the Value Stream Map for the same instance of 'Build' would look as below. Multiple Pipeline Instances A pipeline could be re-triggered multiple times with the same revision. In such cases, all the instances are shown in descending order against that pipeline. In the below example, 'Deploy' has been triggered thrice with counter '2' of pipeline 'FunctionalTests'. Viewing the Value Stream Map Every pipeline label in GoCD directs you to the value stream map of that instance of the pipeline. You can access Value Stream Map for a commit in 2 ways: Permissions The permissions required to view a value stream map are as follows: GoCD Administrators have access to the value stream maps of all the pipelines that are configured. Users with view permissions for a pipeline will be able to view the value stream map for all instances of that pipeline. However, there is one special case to be noted where the pipeline details might not be shown completely. If the user does not have view permissions for a pipeline in the Value Stream Map, its details, like the stages and instances run will not be shown. If you are using Internet Explorer as your browser please note that Value Stream Map is supported with only versions 9 and above."}]}
